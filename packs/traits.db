Experts from the University of Sanbra speculate that the climate change was likely very sudden (At least, sudden in geological terms) given the fact that the Pau'an Species did not evolve or adapt to the high winds as many other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species</a> did. The long gap between Pau'an generations caused by their extremely long lives was probably responsible for this evolutionary stumbling block, and were it not for the migration of Pau'an civilization underground they might not have survived the climate change. </p><p>The shift to life underground did not change the Species' eating habits, as they maintained many of the biological signs of a carnivorous diet. The ecology of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Utapau\" title=\"Utapau\">Utapau</a>, particularly with regard to an abundance of animal life in sinkholes and below ground, allowed the Pau'ans to retain their carnivorous ways, which persist into modern times. </p>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":[],"providedItems":[{"name":"Species Templates","type":"trait"},{"name":"Species Templates","type":"trait"}],"payload":"","buildInstructions":[],"categories":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"prerequisite":null},"name":"Pau'ans","flags":{},"type":"trait","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","_stats":{"systemId":"swse","systemVersion":"0.6.30","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680191831175,"modifiedTime":1680191832118,"lastModifiedBy":"tih8Q1fJUuDFWVCX"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"tih8Q1fJUuDFWVCX":3},"_id":"2WpcpNZZs2x8fM7V"}

In fact, Sakiyans possess what other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species</a> consider nigh-supernatural perception. </p><p>A series of offworld invasions punctuate Sakiyan history, during which the culture survived by maintaining a constant state of vigilance. Evacuation plans are meticulously prepared and constantly revised. Most Sakiyan communities have multiple plans for evacuation in case of invasion and war. Further, every household and government agency relies on lightweight repulsorlift platforms to quickly transport people, resources, and supplies to safe havens. </p><p>Once mobile, Sakiyan troops then conduct a constant series of hit-and-run attacks against enemies until their invaders withdraw from the conquered lands. Sakiyan colonies carry with them the tradition of defense and mobility, resisting domination by <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith</a>, the forces of the Tion Hegemony, and other oppressors. In recent centuries, they have fallen under the economic control of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hutts\">Hutts</a>, but have averted outright enslavement by keeping the \"Slugs\" at arm's length in every place except Saki's major trade centers. </p><p>The ties between the Sakiyans and the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hutts\">Hutts</a> are primarily forged around repulsorlift technology. Sakiyans quickly adopted and improved repulsorlift technology introduced to them by Old Republic scouts. Over the centuries, they have adapted the technology to their needs, focusing primarily on making the motivators smaller and more efficient. The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hutts\">Hutts</a> are particularly fond of Sakiyan repulsorlift technology, as it allows them to construct smaller and more elegant repulsor sleds. </p><p>Thanks to its location near the heart of Hutt Space, the Sakiyan homeworld escaped the tyranny of the Empire, although many Sakiyan technicians were forced to relocate to Imperial research installations, where they contributed to the development of a new generation of Imperial repulsortanks. The Saki System also escaped the notice of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong\" title=\"Yuuzhan Vong\">Yuuzhan Vong</a> as they pressed into Hutt Space- at least during the first advance. The Sakiyan leadership remains concerned that their traditional method of dealing with alien invasions may not work if the war fleets of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong\" title=\"Yuuzhan Vong\">Yuuzhan Vong</a> strike against their home.

In all three major <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eras_of_Play\" title=\"Eras of Play\">Eras of Play</a>, most worlds located at trade-route junctions have at least one Arcona colony, and Arcona can be found at virtually every large spaceport- either as travelers or operators of businesses. </p><p>While most beings consider Arcona cities on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona</a> quality low-tech, the planet has several impressive starports, and many of the galaxy's mining companies operate on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona</a>.

Although the Arcona derive many essential nutrients directly from the world's atmosphere, they also need to consume water and other liquids to keep secondary circulatory systems in their bodies healthy. (This has led some planetary geologists to hypothesize that <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona</a> lost much of its water in some geologically recent catastrophe, though this remains unproven.) </p><p>When it was discovered the Arcona can easily and hopelessly become addicted to sodium chloride (salt) by ingesting even a gram or two of the substance, unscrupulous merchants almost destroyed Arcona society by creating several generations of salt addicts. Salt induces vivid, colorful hallucinations in Arcona, but repeated use damages their body's ability to absorb life-giving ammonia. Only the intervention of the Republic saved the Arcona. The Senate passed draconian laws that punished the importation of salt to the Teke Ro System or to Arcona communities elsewhere in the galaxy, and the Arcona themselves zealously police their communities. Arcona addicted to salt are easily identifiable; their multifaceted eyes turn from green to gold. </p><p>The center of Arcona society is the family, and communities consist of several loosely affiliated extended families.

With no dangerous predators, plenty of rich soil, and warm seas providing potable water full of vital minerals and nutrients, the gangly invertebrates nearly achieved paradise. By the time Old Republic scouts arrived in the star system, the Quermians had settled other nearby worlds and were on the verge of exploring the galaxy at large. They welcomed the strange visitors from the stars. Within a few decades, they were active participants in the galactic community. </p><p>Quermians are famous for their apparent telepathic ability. Quermians can communicate nonverbally by locking eyes with one another. Quermians deny they have telepathy, claiming that they are merely highly attuned to each other's body language. Xenobiologists doubt this claim, pointing to highly unusual activity in parts of Quermian brains, but so far no hard evidence has been provided to confirm or deny psychic powers on the part of all Quermians. </p><p>Quermian society encourages advanced and complicated philosophical contemplation.

Although they have been part of galactic civilization for millennia, very few Umbarans have left their home system, and even fewer have risen to positions of power and fame in the galaxy. Umbarans are interested in alien cultures and civilizations, but they prefer to observe from a distance rather than take an active role in events. </p><p>During the rise of the Empire, the Umbarans spend a few decades moving through the halls of supreme political power. An Umbaran named Sly Moore serves as Palpatine's chief aide during his later years as Chancellor of the Republic and the earliest period of his reign as Emperor. Moore's prominence in galactic politics causes her to be so admired on her homeworld that she inspires other Umbarans to venture out into the rest of the galaxy. Many of them join Moore on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant</a>, and soon Umbarans are a common sight on that world. </p><p>As Palpatine's New Order becomes increasingly biased toward <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans</a>, Moore vanishes from the Emperor's side and moves into more shadowy roles within his government. From deep within the intelligence apparatus, she and other Umbarans lead efforts to root out anyone who is not unquestionably loyal to Emperor Palpatine, and they answer only to the Emperor. They are so effective that even Emperor Palpatine's most dedicated followers grow to fear them, something that strengthens the antialien sentiment among many of the Emperor's closest advisers. The Umbarans are particularly disliked by officers of Imperial Intelligence, who resent the fact that they are subject to Umbaran scrutiny- a resentment that grows every time the Umbarans unmask a Rebel double agent in their ranks. </p><p>After the death of Emperor Palpatine and the collapse of his government, the Umbarans find themselves under threat from the Rebels they had hunted and the New Order supporters they had intimidated.

As the full scope of Emperor Palpatine's evil becomes more evident and knowledge of the atrocities committed in his name more widespread, the Umbarans grow embarrassed over Moore's association with the Emperor, and they resume their reclusive ways.

They have never joined the Republic, or any galactic organization, so most have little reason to leave. They enjoy the technology and wealth produced by the sale of Kolto. All contact with offworlders occurs in Ahto; the Selkath live in underwater cities and settlements scattered around the planet. As amphibious creatures, they are equally at home in either locale. However, those areas closer to Ahto are home to more sophisticated and technologically advanced Selkath settlements. Historically, Selkath settlements were divided by clan affiliation. However, those affiliations have become less pronounced due to the importance of Kolto production. </p>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":[],"providedItems":[{"name":"Species Templates","type":"trait"},{"name":"Species Templates","type":"trait"}],"payload":"","buildInstructions":[],"categories":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"prerequisite":null},"name":"Selkath","flags":{},"type":"trait","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","_stats":{"systemId":"swse","systemVersion":"0.6.30","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680191831144,"modifiedTime":1680191831607,"lastModifiedBy":"tih8Q1fJUuDFWVCX"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"tih8Q1fJUuDFWVCX":3},"_id":"h94Wpn0ahtb7Xg4M"}

Pantorans wear yellow marks on their foreheads, under their eyes, and on their cheeks to denote their family names and lineages. Most Pantorans have a general interest in genealogy and history, and enjoy spending time searching for long-lost relatives and connections to ancient heroes and historical figures. A few Pantorans still hold noble titles.

With the Empire's recognition, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pantora\" title=\"Pantora\">Pantora</a> would gain security both militarily and economically. Another camp insists on maintaining the ideals of the Republic.

A growing few believe that <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pantora\" title=\"Pantora\">Pantora</a> needs to strike out on its own, to found new colonies and exploit new resources.

As with all optional rules, inclusion of the following rules in the game is subject to Gamemaster approval. </p><ul>\n <li><b>Sacrificial Appendage:</b> When a Droid would normally be reduced to 0 Hit Points or moved to the bottom of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Condition Track\">Condition Track</a>, the Droid can choose instead to have one of its limbs severed. \n  <ul>\n   <li>If the Droid chooses this option, it is instead moved to the -4 step on the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Condition Track\">Condition Track</a>, or, in the case of being reduced to 0 Hit Points, it retains 1 Hit Point.</li> \n   <li>The sacrificed <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Appendage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Appendage\">Appendage</a> should be a limb rather than a tool that the Droid can easily do without.</li> \n   <li>The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Appendage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Appendage\">Appendage</a> can be successfully reattached with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Repair\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Repair\">Repair</a>; receiving Hit Points, as usual.</li>\n  </ul></li> \n <li><b>Destroyed Droids:</b> Taking into account the method of destruction, the Gamemaster determines what parts of a Droid remain after it is destroyed. Blaster fire or an explosion might scatter small and large pieces around the area. A Droid destroyed by a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lightsaber\">Lightsaber</a> might have slices or holes burned through its chassis, or large sections of the Droid's appendages might be completely severed. \n  <ul>\n   <li>The Gamemaster should also determine which of the Droid's systems, accessories, appendages, or tools are damaged or destroyed.</li>\n  </ul></li> \n <li><b>Reactivating a Destroyed Droid:</b> At the Gamemaster's discretion, a character can attempt to salvage and reactivate a destroyed Droid. Reactivating a Droid requires that its <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Processor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Processor\">Processor</a>, power source, and communication interface must be intact. The battery and communication interface can be replaced or replicated if needed. \n  <ul>\n   <li>A destroyed Droid cannot reactivate itself. The character attempting the reactivation must make a DC 20 <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics\" title=\"Mechanics\">Mechanics</a> check and work on the droid for 5 minutes.</li> \n   <li>A character can attempt to reactivate a Droid as a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Full-Round Action\">Full-Round Action</a>, increasing the DC to 30. If the check is successful, the Droid moves + 1 step on the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Condition Track\">Condition Track</a>. \n    <ul>\n     <li>However, the Droid is still considered to have 0 Hit Points and cannot move, attack, or take any action other than skill checks for skills based on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence\" title=\"Intelligence\">Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom\" title=\"Wisdom\">Wisdom</a>, or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma\" title=\"Charisma\">Charisma</a>.</li>\n    </ul></li>\n  </ul></li> \n <li><b>Salvaging a Destroyed Droid:</b> Salvaging a destroyed Droid requires a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tool_Kit\" title=\"Tool Kit\">Tool Kit</a>, time, spare parts, and additional <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics\" title=\"Mechanics\">Mechanics</a> checks (see <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Repair\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Repair\">Repair</a>). A reactivated Droid can assist in its own repairs by using the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another\" title=\"Aid Another\">Aid Another</a> Action, although it cannot attempt to repair itself directly. \n  <ul>\n   <li>The time required to salvage a Droid can be affected by the level of destruction sustained by the Droid. Repairs might take several hours, several days, or even several weeks, as determined by the Gamemaster.</li> \n   <li>Destroyed Droids usually require spare parts costing 50% or more of the Droid's original cost.</li>\n  </ul></li>\n</ul><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Improvised_Droid_Tasks\">Improvised Droid Tasks</span></h3><p>Heroes might try to take maximum advantage of the unique resources a droid offers. A Droid's built-in equipment, traits, and unique social status in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe cause Droids and Droid Heroes to be called upon to carry out tasks well beyond their original programming. </p><p>When considering an unusual request for or by a Droid character, consider the following: </p><ul>\n <li><b>Does the Droid have a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heuristic_Processor\" title=\"Heuristic Processor\">Heuristic Processor</a>?</b> If not, then the request must be governed by the standards of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Basic_Processor\" title=\"Basic Processor\">Basic Processor</a> or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Remote_Processor\" title=\"Remote Processor\">Remote Processor</a>, so the task must be laid out in specific terms. Unless the request is defined in ways the Droid understands, the Droid cannot act beyond its programmed <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats\" title=\"Feats\">Feats</a>, special abilities, and tasks. Even if the tasks are clearly delineated, the Droid might perform them poorly or inefficiently or become confused if the task does not proceed as planned. \n  <ul>\n   <li>A Droid equipped with a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heuristic_Processor\" title=\"Heuristic Processor\">Heuristic Processor</a> is better equipped to handle unusual situations, so it can act on fewer, less specific instructions. Additionally, focusing on the advantages of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heuristic_Processor\" title=\"Heuristic Processor\">Heuristic Processor</a> emphasizes the choice of processor in Droid creation, rewarding those players who select it.</li>\n  </ul></li> \n <li><b>Is the request already covered by an existing <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Talent\">Talent</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feat\">Feat</a>, or Droid special quality?</b> Don't shortchange players who select certain Heroic Class, Droid, or Droid Prestige Class <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents\" title=\"Talents\">Talents</a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats\" title=\"Feats\">Feats</a> by allowing other Droids to replicate those abilities too often. If it seems reasonable that a given Droid might be capable of an action similar to an existing ability, allow the action to proceed with a lesser chance of success and/or a lesser result than could be gained with the existing ability.</li> \n <li><b>Is the request likely to be abused by the player in future sessions, or likely to become exploited regularly?</b> If not, allow the idea to be used at least in this instance. However, if the idea could become an unwelcome addition to future sessions, the Gamemaster can avoid denying its use outright by allowing the character to spend a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Force Point\">Force Point</a> or a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny_Point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destiny Point\">Destiny Point</a> (if appropriate) for the action. Another option is for the Droid to suffer a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Persistent Condition\">Persistent Condition</a> and move -1 or more steps on the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Condition Track\">Condition Track</a> at the end of the task.</li> \n <li><b>Should the task be covered by new <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Talent\">Talent</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feat\">Feat</a>, or special quality? </b>Some tasks generated by players are more appropriately covered by creating a new Droid-degree <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Talent\">Talent</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feat\">Feat</a>, or special quality. If the player creates a wholly customized or new Droid Model, a special quality can be added at the Gamemaster's discretion. \n  <ul>\n   <li>If the Droid is an existing stock model, create a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Talent\">Talent</a> or a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feat\">Feat</a> instead. If the ability seems like something a Droid ought to be able to learn, create a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feat\">Feat</a>. If the ability seems focused on a trademark task of a particular model or degree of Droid, create a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Talent\">Talent</a> specific to that degree of Droid.</li>\n  </ul></li> \n <li><b>Adjudicating simple and complex tasks.</b> If the Gamemaster decides to proceed with the request, he or she should decide what actions, attacks, and skill checks are required for success. Simple tasks are typically covered by one skill check, but unique circumstances might require more time and/or multiple checks. Complex tasks should take multiple rounds with multiple checks.</li> \n <li><b>Plan for failure.</b> A Droid that performs a task outside its realm of expertise can make for potentially amusing or unexpected situations if it fails. The Droid might become confused, carry out the next operation without completing the first task, return unexpectedly, call on the owner for clarified instructions, or give up and report the failure. In the middle of a battle or a critical mission, this failure can cause confusion or threaten a mission's success, forcing the heroes to act quickly to resolve the situation. Gamemasters should take advantage of this potentially dramatic or amusing situation.</li>\n</ul><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Droid_that_Gained_levels\">The Droid that Gained levels</span></h3><p>In adventuring parties featuring less than five players, adding a Gamemaster-controlled Droid to the party can be a great way to balance the party without having to adjust your encounter design. Many gaming groups can only muster three or four players and a Gamemaster, while the game is designed for a typical group of five players and a GM. Filling those empty player spots with Droids is a nice option, because a Droid can easily fade into the background during noncombat encounters, whereas a living character that does so might seem shallow and one-dimensional. If you decide to include a Droid ally as a means of filling out the party's numbers, you should probably think about the Droid just like you would any other major Gamemaster character, and plan on it being with the party for the duration of the campaign. </p><p>You should choose a Droid Model that fills an appropriate niche in the party. Similarly, you should probably think about the kinds of adventures your heroes are going to be going on, and what roles need to be filled. If the party lacks a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)\" title=\"Pilot (Vehicle Combat)\">Pilot</a>, a Pilot Droid seems like a good choice. However, there are other considerations. Some Droids don't do well on adventures due to their forms (try getting that <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wheeled\" title=\"Wheeled\">Wheeled</a> Droid up a long set of stairs). A good option for creating Droids to round out a party of heroes is to use a stock <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid_Chassis\" title=\"Droid Chassis\">Droid Chassis</a> and then build the Droid from the ground up. This not only lets you build exactly the kind of Droid you need to fill a gap in the party, it unshackles you from the usual physical forms of various Droids. </p><p>As the heroes gain levels, so should the Droid. The levels you choose for your Droid should likewise continue to help the Droid fill in the gaps in the party. If the party is short on firepower, the Droid should take levels with a high <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Base Attack Bonus\">Base Attack Bonus</a> and good combat <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents\" title=\"Talents\">Talents</a>. However, you also have another option to consider. If you want the Droid to grow and to develop as an interesting Gamemaster character, consider having the Droid take levels in the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Independent_Droid\" title=\"Independent Droid\">Independent Droid</a> Prestige Class. This helps represent the fact that the Droid is becoming more and more unique thanks to its time with a party of heroes at the center of great, galaxy-shaking events. </p>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":[],"providedItems":[{"name":"Optional Rules","type":"trait"},{"name":"Optional Rules","type":"trait"},{"name":"Optional Rules","type":"trait"}],"payload":"","buildInstructions":[],"categories":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"prerequisite":null},"name":"Droid Traits","flags":{},"type":"trait","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","_stats":{"systemId":"swse","systemVersion":"0.6.30","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680191831148,"modifiedTime":1680191831630,"lastModifiedBy":"tih8Q1fJUuDFWVCX"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"tih8Q1fJUuDFWVCX":3},"_id":"yzAogv8bRZeJRrgu"}
