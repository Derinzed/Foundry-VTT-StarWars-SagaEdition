In this constant battle between energy needs and engine size, one solution is to add Auxiliary Generators.Auxiliary Generators are able to step in and supply power to specific systems when engine power is needed to propel the ship or engage in other crucial functions (Such as maintaining the shields). Because they need to produce power only at peak usage, the generators are smaller and use less fuel than an equivalent engine upgrade. This doesn't provide any additional speed for the Starship in question, but it does give it more power when engines or tractors beams are at maximum capacity.Auxiliary Generators give a Starship a +2, +4, or +6 equipment bonus to its Strength score.

This results in wide swaths being cut through limited areas, perfect for clearing landing sites.When attacking with a Composite Prismatic Turbolaser Cannon, everything within a 15-Square Cone (Character Scale) must make a DC 10 Dexterity check or else they are struck by the weapon. A roll of a Natural 1 on the check means the target is hit twice. Note that anyone with Cover, gains whatever bonus to their Dexterity check that it would grant their Reflex Defense.","attributes":{"0":{"override":false,"value":"2d10x5","key":"damage"},"1":{"override":false,"value":"15","key":"emplacementPoints"}},"source":"Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook - Vehicles and Vessels"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"Pvm9rLmBy47cH9jv"}

Ships in these squares and ships that enter these squares are pulled from Hyperspace and cannot enter Hyperspace again while in one of these squares.","attributes":{"0":{"override":false,"value":"","key":"damage"},"1":{"override":false,"value":"2","key":"emplacementPoints"}},"source":"Star Wars Saga Edition Legacy Era Campaign Guide"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"eXVGLDaFsqaJm1Nm"}

Because of its inherent unreliability, Class .5 Hyperdrives are Illegal under all but the most unusual circumstances.A Class .5 Hyperdrive is very carefully tuned and delicate, so it tends to malfunction much more often than a standard Hyperdrive. It requires eight hours of maintenance per month and a DC 20 Mechanics check to keep one running smoothly. If the maintenance isn't kept up, or the Mechanics check for doing so fails, you take a -5 penalty on Use Computer checks made to Astrogate until the Hyperdrive receives proper maintenance. Furthermore, any time you would normally have an Astrogation Mishap, the Hyperdrive is instead disabled until repaired (Normally requiring 1 hour of work and a DC 20 Mechanics check).The Class 1 Hyperdrive is considered the pinnacle of stable Hyperdrive technology from the Clone Wars forward. It is the favored technology of military vessels, but it's high cost often results in designers settling for a Class 2 or Class 3 drive, which were state of the art during most of the Rise of the Empire era.A Hyperdrive of Class 4 to Class 6 is normally either old technology or an aftermarket retrofit crammed into a vessel not designed to support a Hyperdrive.

One such design concept was the idea of the Tall Walker. The advantage of towering over your enemies not only provided intimidation, but a superior view of the battlefield and field of fire. Further, Tall Walkers kept the main-body of the Walker far enough away from the ground for Antivehicle Mines to read them as troopers instead of Vehicles. The added height also allowed for skilled pilots to stomp on targets, something its stubby-legged cousins were unable to do. Unfortunately, enemies of Tall Walkers quickly learned that they were prone to being toppled by means of tripwires or bad footing.Having the Tall Walker emplacement makes it so that Gargantuan or smaller walkers do not set off Antivehicle Mines, even when passing through their square. Colossal Walkers will only trigger Antivehicle Mines if one of their legs lands directly on the mine. Tall Walkers gain a +5 bonus to all Perception checks. Tall Walkers can also make a melee attack as a Standard Action against adjacent targets at least one size category smaller than them. The attack bonus and damage is determined as though it were a Falling Object being forced downward.Unfortunately, Tall Walkers are susceptible to being toppled. Any failed Pilot check results in the Walker staggering. A staggering Walker takes a -5 penalty to all rolls and checks and is unable to move from its current square for 2 rounds. The Walker’s Pilot must make a Pilot check (DC 20) to stabilize the Walker. If this roll also fails, the Walker topples over, immediately taking double its normal Collision damage and is considered Helpless if it is not destroyed.

The System Operator activates or deactivates the system with a Swift Action. There are two different types of Automated Weapon Emplacements- Basic and Advanced. These two systems operate in very different ways.A Basic Automated Weapon Emplacement is essentially a dumb fire system that must be preprogrammed. The System Operator can select any square or cluster of squares (Number of squares equal to the Vehicle’s Cost Modifier) within the weapon’s range and firing arc (Or merely within range if the weapon is a turret). Once per round, if any target moves into or through this square, the weapon opens fire as a Reaction. The targeted square can be changed once per round as an additional Swift Action. A Basic Automated Weapon effectively has an attack bonus equal to the ship’s Intelligence modifier. Friends can be distinguished and excluded from the systems’ firing solution, which requires one Swift Action per target from the System Operator (This is performed automatically if the ship has an IFF Transponder installed).An Advanced Automated Weapon Emplacement is capable of operating in dumb fire mode, but uses a Droid Brain integrated into the weapon to also enable a smart fire system. Once activated, the system will intelligently select and fire on perceived threats to the ship. A stock Advanced Automated Weapon Emplacement costs 8,000 credits times the craft’s Cost Modifier and functions as if controlled by a level 1 Nonheroic Droid with Strength and Dexterity scores of 10 and an Intelligence score equal to the ship to which it is installed. These emplacements can be customized, adding Nonheroic levels to the Droid Brain at a cost of 5,000 credits times the craft’s Cost Modifier per level and a successful Use Computer check (DC 25). The level of the Automated Weapon Emplacement's Character Level cannot exceed the Challenge Level of the craft in which it is installed.Any Weapon System that also possesses the Autofire option can use it in conjunction with the automated weapon option.

{"name":"Hardpoint","type":"vehicleSystem","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"cost":"500","subtype":"Starship Accessories","description":"Each Hardpoint Array counts as a single weapon; if multiple arrays carry identical payloads, they can be Fire-Linked. It's possible to replace any of the payload choices with a simple DC 15 Mechanics check and 1 minute of work. The cost of a Hardpoint does not include the cost of the payload attached to it.A Starship can have a number of loaded Hardpoint Arrays equal to its Cost Modifier without penalty, and it can carry twice this amount as a Heavy Load. Carrying a Heavy Load reduces the Starship's speed to three-quarters normal and allows it to move only three times its speed with the All-Out Movement Action; in addition, the Pilot takes a -10 penalty on Initiative and Pilot checks. Hardpoints carrying no payload do not count for purposes of calculating Encumbrance.Because they are outside launchers or racks, the payloads on Hardpoints are vulnerable. Any time a Starship moves one step down its Condition Track as a result of damage, half the payload in its Hardpoints are lost (Chosen randomly).Although loaded Hardpoints are extremely obvious, a Hardpoint with no missile or mine attached retracts or folds against the hull, making them difficult to notice (DC 25 Perception or Use Computer check to detect, modified by range). This makes them an excellent choice for any ship that goes into the rough fringes of the spacelanes occasionally but still needs to pass for a civilian ship the rest of the time.","attributes":{"0":{"override":false,"value":"1","key":"emplacementPoints"}},"source":"Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"z61CM43Ds9N2ZOVF"}

If you wish to review this content yourself, then see Untested for more details.Laser Panel Arrays house hundreds of tiny, rapid-moving short range laser beams that swivel so fast the entire panel appears to emit a uniform glow. This technology allows the digger to vaporize rock and metal at a superior rate to beam-drills, and with far greater precision than blasting can offer.In order to dig, the Laser Panel Array must first move into the same square as its target, in the case of Vehicles of Large or greater size, only the first row of squares moves into the same square as its target. Each round, the Laser Panel Array rolls an attack against the wall or similar barrier it is drilling through (See Object Statistics for information on various barriers and materials).The Laser Panel Array deals 2d10x2 damage per attack, until the barrier is destroyed. In cases where the barrier is more than 1-square thick, 1.5 meters worth of the substance is vaporized. Upon destruction, an opening is created that is the same number of squares wide as the Vehicle the panels are mounted on, and 2-squares tall.The damage output for the Laser Panel Array can be increased in 1d10 increments at the cost of 3,000 credits per additional die of damage (To a maximum of 6d10x2).","attributes":{"0":{"override":false,"value":"2d10x2","key":"damage"},"1":{"override":false,"value":"3","key":"emplacementPoints"}},"source":"Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook - Vehicles and Vessels"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"zN4qXlnw0uwd8MKK"}

These systems allow for communication within a star system, including sending and receiving signals to personal Comlinks.Some ships require superior communications and are equipped with Hypertransceivers or HoloNet Transceivers. Hypertransceivers effectively have an unlimited range, allowing ships at opposite ends of the galaxy to communicate with each other, although such communications can experience significant time lag. Hypertransceivers also give a ship access to information on The HoloNet, though not with the full detail of a Holonet Transceiver. Most military vessels carry a Hypertransceiver.HoloNet Transceivers are extremely rare and expensive systems that allow for real-time audio, visual, and holographic communication over an unlimited range. HoloNet Transceivers function by taking advantage of the vast system of HoloNet satellites built during the days of the Old Republic. Only the most important ships carry HoloNet Transceivers; during the reign of The Galactic Empire, HoloNet Transceivers have an availability of Military instead of Restricted. All Use Computer checks made to gain information with a HoloNet Transceiver gain a +5 Equipment bonus.Hypertransceivers and HoloNet Transceivers are the only means of communicating with a Starship in Hyperspace. However, they can do so only if both ships are traveling along the same path in Hyperspace or if one ship is near the point of arrival or departure for the ship in Hyperspace.If multiple ships with HoloNet Transceivers work together, they can create their own secure communications network, such as was done with Banking Clan Frigates.","attributes":{"0":{"override":false,"value":"4","key":"emplacementPoints"}},"source":"Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"zUk9wabj2tKVi0ye"}
