The first time during an encounter that you would be moved to the bottom of the Condition Track by any effect, you instead stop at the -4 step (Move at Half Speed; -10 Penalty to all Defenses; -10 Penalty on Attack Rolls, Ability Checks, and Skill Checks). Additionally, if a single attack causes you to move multiple steps down the Condition Track, you can spend a Force Point as a Reaction to only move -1 step down the Condition Track.","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":[],"providedItems":[],"payload":"","prerequisite":null,"categories":[{"value":"Talent Trees"},{"value":"Droid Talent Trees"}],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":["Droid Talent Trees"],"isSupplied":false,"talentTree":"5th-Degree Droid Talent Tree","talentTreeSource":"","talentTreeUrl":"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/5th-Degree_Droid_Talent_Tree","bonusTalentTree":"5th-Degree Droid Talent Tree"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"zwjvHYOO1gxkMXkw"}
