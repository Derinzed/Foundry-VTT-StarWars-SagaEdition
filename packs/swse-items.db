Also, the Sonar Mapper does not have as great a range as a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sensor_Pack\" title=\"Sensor Pack\">Sensor Pack</a>, because it reads the pulses only up to a range of 100 meters with any degree of accuracy.

They abandoned their pasts and were driven to the farthest reaches of the galaxy by the remaining Jedi. For thousands of years, The Jedi thought their long-lost traitorous comrades gone and forgotten. But when Hyperspace explorers discover an empire ruled with an iron fist by the descendants of those fallen Jedi, the Order realizes that the exiles had found and enslaved a people called the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Offshoot\" title=\"Sith Offshoot\">Sith</a>, taking the name as their own. When the whole of this Sith Empire turns its terrifying might against the Republic in <span class=\"new\" title=\"The Great Hyperspace War (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVGhlX0dyZWF0X0h5cGVyc3BhY2VfV2FyP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\">The Great Hyperspace War</span>, The Jedi fully grasp the consequences of that nearly forgotten decision to banish their fallen comrades. </p>\n <p>Some Jedi denounce the Order's zeal to extinguish every trace of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith</a> in the war's aftermath, and many think <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith</a> extinct. Then the mortal enemy of The Jedi returns in force. First the Jedi Knight Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma turn to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side</a> and ally themselves with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Krath\" title=\"The Krath\">The Krath</a>, a Dark Side cult borne of ancient Sith tradition.

The Jedi High Council is a largely ceremonial body with no real authority over Jedi. Jedi Masters and Watchmen are entrusted to maintain peace and train the new generations of Jedi, allowing remarkable diversity and freedom of ideas. Though a dichotomy of \"Light\" and \"Dark\" remains firmly entrenched, schools of though abound about how to best serve <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force</a>.

But around the year 28,000 BBY, the archetypal model of ambition rises to power among them. This inflexible Sith ruler unites his world into a single kingdom, and claims the titles of both monarch and god of his people. History calls him King Adas, but according to legend, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force</a> bristows on him a different name: <i>Sith'ari</i>- the perfect being. </p>\n <p>Three thousand years before the founding of the Republic, Adas' hegemony is invaded by <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Infinite_Empire\" title=\"The Infinite Empire\">The Infinite Empire</a>, an immensely powerful interstellar nation. Here, later Sith would say, they prove their right to rule the galaxy. Outsmarting the technologically superior invaders, Adas conquers the conquerors, sacrificing his life in the process.

But there is a greater gift <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Infinite_Empire\" title=\"The Infinite Empire\">The Infinite Empire</a> bequeathed to The Sith- <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side</a> of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force</a>. </p>\n <p>Eventually, The Sith are again visited by aliens, this time by Dark Jedi exiled in the Hundred-Year Darkness. These exiles, initially called <i>Jen'jidai</i> in the Sith tongue, easily conquer the reigning Sith overlord, earning their leader Ajunta Pall the title <i>Jen'ari</i> or \"Dark Lord\" of the Sith. Though a number of these Sith conquerors follow their leaders back to Republic space for revenge against <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi</a>, many stay to interbreed with The Sith by alchemical means. For the next two thousand years, Jedi blood mixes with Sith, breeding out feeble characteristics of each <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species</a>- such as superstition, sympathy, and loyalty- while sharpening desirable qualities such as ambition, cunning, and raw power in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force</a>. At last, around the year 5,000 BBY, The Sith Empire, led by the Dark Lord Naga Sadow, is ready and invades Republic space. </p>\n <p>Because of treason, the Sith campaign fails, and special enforcers called <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Shadows\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jedi Shadows\">Jedi Shadows</a> zealously eradicate every last vestige of The Sith they find. But in a twist of irony, a few short centuries later, the Jedi Knight Freedon Nadd finds two Sith relics the Shadows missed. Taking instruction from both King Adas' Holocron and Sadow's disembodied spirit, Nadd becomes a Dark Lord. In turn, he inculcates the Jedi Exar Kun into The Sith creed, consequently bringing the Republic to its knees as Kun's Brotherhood of the Sith instigates <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Sith_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Great Sith War\">The Great Sith War</a>. </p>\n <p>Kun's Brotherhood is defeated, and in another blow, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mecrosa_Order\" title=\"The Mecrosa Order\">The Mecrosa Order</a>, a long-time Sith bastion, overplays its hand in the Tapani Sector and is completely annihilated in The Cleansing of the Nine Houses.

As the former homeworld of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith</a>, Korriban is riddled with thousands of tombs, catacombs, caves, and temples dedicated to fallen Sith Lords from ages past. The planet is harsh and desolate, continually under the pall of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side</a>, which has tainted every rock, plant, and animal.

After <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Sith_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Great Sith War\">The Great Sith War</a>, mercenaries were common in Dreshdae, in addition to smugglers and bounty hunters who found the lawless nature of the place suitable to their taste. During <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Old Republic Era\">The Old Republic Era</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Czerka_Corporation\" title=\"The Czerka Corporation\">The Czerka Corporation</a> established their sector headquarters on Korriban, instituting harsh discipline for their employees. Korriban became a hub of weapon smuggling during this time as well. </p>\n <p>The Sith Training Academy was located on the outskirts of Dreshdae, close to the Valley of the Dark Lords. It was a place where Sith were trained in a similar manner as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi</a>, with hundreds of students receiving instruction from Sith Masters. However, training was exceedingly dangerous; cheating, subterfuge, and elimination of rivals was not only accepted but highly encouraged. Young students would often travel to Dreshdae during their down time, anxious to start fights with the locals or the bands of mercenaries that frequented the spaceport. </p>\n <p>The Valley of the Dark Lords is the most famous place on Korriban. Closely located to the Sith Training Academy and the capital, Dreshdae, the valley is filled with huge, ominous statues and cyclopean tombs, many of which are partially buried in the sand. Known tombs include those of the Sith Lords Tulak Hord, Ludo Kressh, Ajunta Pall, Marka Ragnos, and Naga Sadow. A tomb was even created for Darth Vader, although it was never used and was offered instead to Emperor Palpatine. These tombs are filled with all manner of traps, dangerous beasts, and the spirits of Sith Lords who take tremendous umbrage with tomb raiders. The Valley of the Dark Lords is a Minor <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Site\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dark Side Site\">Dark Side Site</a>; however, the actual tombs themselves are Major <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Sites\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dark Side Sites\">Dark Side Sites</a>, or in the case of Naga Sadow's tomb, an Extreme <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Site\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dark Side Site\">Dark Side Site</a>. </p>\n <p>The tombs hold tremendous treasure, as well as temptation and corruption for all who enter. As one of the most sacred sites for <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith</a>, the Valley of the Dark Lords is a common destination for Sith seeking knowledge and power. The spirits of the Sith Lords are fickle and demanding, however, and few of these seekers have the willpower and command of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side</a> to be deemed worthy for such instruction. More than a few pairing Sith wind up entombed along with the moldering bones of the Sith Lords, their essence feeding <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side</a> that permeates the very foundations of the place. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Korriban_Adventure_Hooks\">Korriban Adventure Hooks</span></h3> \n <p>Korriban is full of dangerous locations suffused with the insidious power of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side</a>.

To succeed, the heroes must also maintain their cover as cruel students of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith</a> philosophy.</li> \n  <li>The Jedi Council authorizes a number of hunting expeditions to Korriban to eliminate the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Terentatek\" title=\"Terentatek\">Terentatek</a> from the galaxy.

{"name":"Energy Shield (SR 5)","type":"armor","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"finalName":"","description":"Energy Shields give a character a Shield Rating, which functions exactly as normal shielding. An energy-shield generator is typically worn on the forearm or upper arm and must be activated as a Swift Action. Energy Shields typically have 5 charges, and energy shields can only be activated once per encounter (the stress on the shield generator causes the device to overload otherwise, so the manufacturers build in failsafes to prevent such an occurrence).\n\nEach activation consumes one charge and lasts through the end of the encounter. An Energy Shield only protects against weapons that deal Energy damage; a weapon that deals any other type of damage bypasses the shield's SR entirely.\n\nThe Shield Rating provided by the Energy Shield determines the Energy Shield's price, as well as the type of Armor Proficiency feat required to operate the Energy Shield without penalty (Armor Proficiency (Light), Armor Proficiency (Medium), or Armor Proficiency (Heavy)).\n\nEnergy Shields come in three varieties: Light, Medium, and Heavy. Each Energy Shield type corresponds to an armor type (Light is Light Armor, Medium is Medium Armor, and Heavy is Heavy Armor). A character with an active Energy Shield without the relevant Armor Proficiency feat takes a -5 penalty to their Reflex Defense, and the wearer is denied its Dexterity bonus to their Reflex Defense (though they still gain the benefits of the Energy Shield).\n\nRegardless of whether or not the character is proficient with the Energy Shield, the character always takes the Armor Check Penalty associated with the Energy Shield while it is activated. Additionally, each type of Energy Shield imposes its Maximum Dexterity Bonus restriction only when activated, not when worn and inert.\n\nAn Energy Shield can be added to a suit of armor as an Armor Accessory. An Energy Shield can be modified by Armor Templates only if the Template specifically states that it can be used on Energy Shields, and the Energy Shield confers that benefit only when it is activated.","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{"0":{"override":false,"value":"Energy Shield","key":"actsAsForProficiency"},"1":{"override":false,"value":5,"key":"shieldRating"},"2":{"override":false,"value":4,"key":"maximumDexterityBonus"}},"choices":[],"modes":{},"providedItems":{},"payload":"","cost":"500","weight":"","availability":"","size":"","type":"","subtype":"Light Armor","categories":[],"items":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"armorType":""},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"AeP1M1J9bKo2YLBa"}

The original Sith were a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Human\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Near-Human\">Near-Human</a> population on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban\" title=\"Korriban\">Korriban</a>, subjected and ruled by outcast Dark Jedi several thousand years before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin</a>. The name \"Sith\" eventually came to refer to the Dark Side cult that ruled the Sith people (that is, the \"Lords of the Sith\"). When <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic\" title=\"The Old Republic\">The Old Republic</a> discovered <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith_Empire\" title=\"The Sith Empire\">The Sith Empire</a> thousands of years later, it lead to the Great Hyperspace War, the first of a long series of conflicts that ravaged the galaxy over the next few millennia. Eventually, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith_Empire\" title=\"The Sith Empire\">The Sith Empire</a> (now known as the \"Old Sith\") was destroyed, and all it left behind were ancient <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Holocrons\" title=\"Holocrons\">Holocrons</a> and the ruined tombs and temples on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban\" title=\"Korriban\">Korriban</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin_4\" title=\"Yavin 4\">Yavin 4</a>, and a handful of other planets throughout the galaxy. </p>\n <p>The current incarnation of The Sith (the \"New Sith\") is the result of another Dark Jedi who broke away from the order. Two thousand years before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin</a>, this Dark Jedi had come to the understanding that the true power of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force</a> lay not through contemplation and passivity, but by tapping into one's emotions and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side</a>. Renaming himself Darth Ruin, he stole a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Holocron\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sith Holocron\">Sith Holocron</a> from the archives of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Order\">The Jedi Order</a> and began gathering followers to his banner. Awakening beliefs from the dark past, the New Sith cult began to grow, driven by the promise of new powers attainable by tapping into the hateful energies of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side</a>. It was only a matter of time before the order self-destructed. Internecine struggles by power-hungry Sith practitioners dwindled their numbers. Weakened by infighting, The Sith were easily wiped out by <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi</a> at the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ruusan\" title=\"Ruusan\">Ruusan</a>, one thousand years after Darth Ruin founded the Order. </p>\n <p>However, one Sith had the cunning to survive. Darth Bane resurrected the cult so that there could only be two- no more, no less; a master and an apprentice. Bane adopted cunning, subterfuge, and stealth as the fundamental tenets of the new Sith Order. Bane took an apprentice. When that apprentice succeeded him, that new Sith Lord would take an apprentice. Thus, The Sith quietly continued for centuries, until the time of Darth Sidious. With great cunning and treachery, Sidious fomented a galactic civil war within the Republic, seized control of the Galactic Senate, wiped out <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Order\">The Jedi Order</a>, and replaced <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic\" title=\"The Galactic Republic\">The Galactic Republic</a> with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire\" title=\"The Galactic Empire\">The Galactic Empire</a>. With Sidious as the Emperor and Darth Vader as his loyal apprentice, The Sith ruled the galaxy and plunged it into darkness. It remained so for decades until a new hope arose to bring Darth Vader back from <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side</a> and extinguish the menace of The Sith. </p>\n <p>The Sith Order rises once again in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legacy_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Legacy Era\">The Legacy Era</a>, some 140 years after the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin</a>. The new Sith are led by the enigmatic Darth Krayt and serve as Dark Side enforcers to the reincarnated Empire. Though The Sith are not as common as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi</a> were during the days of the Republic, it is not uncommon to have a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Apprentice\" title=\"Sith Apprentice\">Sith Apprentice</a> or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Lord\" title=\"Sith Lord\">Sith Lord</a> attached to an important mission or garrison. </p> \n <h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Membership\"><b>Membership</b></span></h4> \n <p>Any character with the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Sensitivity\" title=\"Force Sensitivity\">Force Sensitivity</a> feat can become a member of The Sith by being accepted as an apprentice by a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Lord\" title=\"Sith Lord\">Sith Lord</a>.

An Energy Shield only protects against weapons that deal Energy damage; a weapon that deals any other type of damage bypasses the shield's SR entirely.\n\nThe Shield Rating provided by the Energy Shield determines the Energy Shield's price, as well as the type of Armor Proficiency feat required to operate the Energy Shield without penalty (Armor Proficiency (Light), Armor Proficiency (Medium), or Armor Proficiency (Heavy)).\n\nEnergy Shields come in three varieties: Light, Medium, and Heavy. Each Energy Shield type corresponds to an armor type (Light is Light Armor, Medium is Medium Armor, and Heavy is Heavy Armor). A character with an active Energy Shield without the relevant Armor Proficiency feat takes a -5 penalty to their Reflex Defense, and the wearer is denied its Dexterity bonus to their Reflex Defense (though they still gain the benefits of the Energy Shield).\n\nRegardless of whether or not the character is proficient with the Energy Shield, the character always takes the Armor Check Penalty associated with the Energy Shield while it is activated. Additionally, each type of Energy Shield imposes its Maximum Dexterity Bonus restriction only when activated, not when worn and inert.\n\nAn Energy Shield can be added to a suit of armor as an Armor Accessory.

However, Droids do not have <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution\" title=\"Constitution\">Constitution</a> scores because they are not actually living beings; they only need scores for their five remaining <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Abilities\" title=\"Abilities\">Abilities</a>. You can determine your <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ability_Scores\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ability Scores\">Ability Scores</a> in one of the following ways: </p> \n <ul>\n  <li><b>Rolling:</b> Roll 4d6 five times, discarding the lowest die each time. Add up the remaining three dice and assign the result to any one of your five <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Abilities\" title=\"Abilities\">Abilities</a>.</li> \n  <li><b>Planned Generation:</b> All of your Ability Scores start at 8, and you have 21 points to spend to increase them. (Refer to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Planned_Generation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Planned Generation\">Planned Generation</a>.)</li> \n  <li><b>Standard Score Package:</b> The Standard Score Package for Droid heroes is 15, 14, 13, 12, and 10. Assign these five scores to your five <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Abilities\" title=\"Abilities\">Abilities</a> as you see fit.</li>\n </ul> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Degree\">Degree</span></h3> \n <p>Droids are classified by Degree, reflecting the types of tasks they typically perform. Generally, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/1st-Degree_Droids\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"1st-Degree Droids\">1st-Degree Droids</a> are medical and analytical Droids, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/2nd-Degree_Droids\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"2nd-Degree Droids\">2nd-Degree Droids</a> are mechanical and technical Droids, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/3rd-Degree_Droids\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"3rd-Degree Droids\">3rd-Degree Droids</a> are protocol and domestic Droids, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/4th-Degree_Droids\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"4th-Degree Droids\">4th-Degree Droids</a> are security and battle Droids, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/5th-Degree_Droids\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"5th-Degree Droids\">5th-Degree Droids</a> are labor and utility Droids.

While <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legacy_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Legacy Era\">The Legacy Era</a> shares many common elements with other popular time periods, this section helps present some of the unique elements that can be emphasized to give a Legacy Era Campaign its own feel. </p>\n <p>One key aspect of Legacy Era Campaign is the concept of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Legacies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Legacies\">Legacies</a>, which provide ample fodder for character development.

Through legal and political maneuvers, Jacen Solo and Supreme Commander Niathal displace the Chief of State Cal Omas.

Their usefulness makes them a common sight on nearly every inhabited world in the galaxy.

To the vast majority of Droids, the concept of Droid independence is unthinkable. Without someone to command them, what would they do? </p>\n <p>Even so, ownership and control are two very different things. Droids must do what they are commanded to do to the best of their ability, but their programming dictates how they accomplish their orders. Ordered to find a replacement part for an X-wing, a Droid might commence a systematic search of the repair bay, then the docking facility, then the neighborhood, then the countryside, and so on- all while thinking its actions are perfectly logical. Droids often need very specific instructions to do what their masters command, in a manner meeting their master's expectations. </p>\n <p>Occasionally, events conspire to lead a Droid to independence. These so-called \"self-owned\" Droids are few, but not as rare as many believe. One might hear stories of Droids that escape their masters after years of abuse, or of an entire line of Droids that manifest violent personalities as the result of a programming glitch. However, independent Droids are rarely haywire, rampaging killers. Independent Droids often enter into partnerships organic beings, particularly on worlds where a lone Droid without a master draws a lot of unwanted attention. Independent Droids sometimes even seek each other out, hoping to find strength and security in numbers. Some independent Droids are thrust into the unlikely role of hero, helping to defend the galaxy from the depredations of evil as personified by the likes of the Empire and the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong\" title=\"Yuuzhan Vong\">Yuuzhan Vong</a>. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Droid_Heroes\">Droid Heroes</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid_Heroes\" title=\"Droid Heroes\">Droid Heroes</a></i> </p>\n <p>If you want to play a Droid as a hero, you can either play an existing Droid from this section or create your own unique Droid hero. Droid heroes are assumed either to be \"self-owned\" or to be owned by another player character (with the approval of both the Gamemaster and the player in question). Even if owned by another member of the party, the Gamemaster should ensure that the owner does not abuse their authority by giving unreasonable or unwanted orders to the other player's Droid character. A Droid player character should be treated the same as any other player character, and in most cases it is best to give suggestions or advice instead of actual orders. (In fact, most Droid heroes have a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heuristic_Processor\" title=\"Heuristic Processor\">Heuristic Processor</a> so that they can creatively interpret orders and thus justify acting as they wish.) </p>\n <p>When you decide to play a Droid hero, you'll have to pack out a few details about what type of Droid your character will be.

Secrets are whispered in dark corners, bribes pass through corrupt hands, and saboteurs and assassins directly attack the resources and allies of their enemies. A campaign full of intrigue is a campaign full of mystery, where as one layer of the plot is revealed, so are three more mysteries whose true meaning have yet to be discovered. </p>  \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Introduction\" title=\"GoI Introduction\">Introduction</a></i> </p>\n <p>The civilizations of the <i>Star Wars</i> galaxy are bound together in an intricate web of intrigue. Except for the most reclusive, every sentient being in the galaxy is involved in a conspiracy or plot, whether he or she knows it or not. A plot might be as benign as a corporation's ad campaign or as insidious as a scheme to overthrow the Republic. Heroes are pushed and pulled by powerful forces, such as planetary governments, the Jedi Council, or the military. A hero might owe a favor or have an obligation to someone and in turn wield control over others. Because of this web of intrigue, an <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intrigue_Campaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intrigue Campaign\">Intrigue Campaign</a> can quickly move from the immediate to the vast, depending on how involved and wide-ranging the Gamemaster wants to make the adventure. </p>\n <p><i>Galaxy of Intrigue</i> is designed for any era of the <i>Star Wars</i> timeline. Whether during the Old Republic, Clone Wars, Rebellion, or Legacy eras, life in the galaxy is complicated, as planets wage war with each other, ideologies clash, and rulers fight for domination and to achieve the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destinies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destinies\">Destinies</a> that lie within their reach. Even the relative peace preceding the Clone Wars is riddled with intrigue as groups and individuals take advantage of a distracted and apathetic populace to forward their own agendas. </p>\n <p>With <i>Galaxy of Intrigue</i>, Gamemasters can plunge heroes into a campaign of conspiracy. Although the heroes might be caught up in the plots of others, they can take an active role in solving mysteries or using their influence to help shape the galaxy, pulling the strings of intrigue themselves. <i>Galaxy of Intrigue</i> presents rules and suggestions for including noncombat elements into a campaign, allowing players with a flair for personal interaction, dialogue, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Skill\">Skill</a> use to stand out. Characters from the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble\" title=\"Noble\">Noble</a> Heroic Class, with the most <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills</a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents\" title=\"Talents\">Talents</a> for solving problems with dialogue or quick thinking, benefit most from the ideas presented in <i>Galaxy of Intrigue</i>. However, <i>Galaxy of Intrigue</i> offers plenty for every <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Heroic Class\">Heroic Class</a>, even the most martial <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soldiers\">Soldiers</a>. The rules and ideas presented here should give the heroes of your campaign a new sense of purpose, helping them develop into multidimensional characters. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Heroes_of_Intrigue\">Heroes of Intrigue</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Heroes_of_Intrigue\" title=\"GoI Heroes of Intrigue\">Heroes of Intrigue</a></i> </p>\n <p>Although the <i>Star Wars</i> universe is replete with scenes of breathtaking action, dramatic lightsaber duels, sweeping ship battles, and hair-raising escapes, it is also deeply immersed in intrigue. The galaxy is an enormous place with a huge variety of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species</a>, ideologies, corporations, and other groups jockeying to gain power and to carve their own destinies. A dense, if delicate, web of negotiations, treaties, alliances, and obligations weaves disparate groups together to stop the civilizations of the galaxy from descending into chaos. Sometimes this web keeps the peace, but often stability is threatened or overturned as masterminds scheme for more control. For the heroes, adventure is around every corner and, more often than not, comes looking for them instead of the other way around. </p>\n <p>An <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intrigue_Campaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intrigue Campaign\">Intrigue Campaign</a> has plenty of room for every type of character, although creating heroes for an <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intrigue_Campaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intrigue Campaign\">Intrigue Campaign</a> requires a bit more thought than it might in other settings. Campaigns that focus on intrigue are less about kicking down doors and tossing thermal detonators (although these is a time and place for that, as well) than about the gradual, but steady, discovery of information and secrets as the heroes unravel plots. This chapter provides more <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats\" title=\"Feats\">Feats</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents\" title=\"Talents\">Talents</a>, and a new twist on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills</a> to help your characters fit into a world of backroom deals, clandestine meetings, blackmail, infiltration, and political maneuvering. </p>\n <p>At first glance, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble\" title=\"Noble\">Noble</a> Heroic Class seems to be the wisest choice in an <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intrigue_Campaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intrigue Campaign\">Intrigue Campaign</a>. To be sure, with its tremendous amount of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills</a> and its intrigue-inspired <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent_Trees\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Talent Trees\">Talent Trees</a>, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble\" title=\"Noble\">Noble</a> Heroic Class is well suited for this type of campaign, but the other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Classes\" title=\"Heroic Classes\">Heroic Classes</a> have just as much to offer. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scoundrels\">Scoundrels</a> use their silver tongues or dastardly tricks for their own personal gain. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scouts\">Scouts</a>, as masters of infiltration, use their resources to break into government facilities or corporate offices to retrieve valuable information. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soldiers\">Soldiers</a> need not be brutish thugs and can include military intelligence officers or bodyguards for the rich and powerful, picking up vital secrets as they go about their duties. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi\" title=\"Jedi\">Jedi</a>, known for their role as peacekeepers and negotiators, find themselves wrapped up in densely woven plots and shifting agendas on a daily basis. In short, every <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Heroic Class\">Heroic Class</a> has its place in an <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intrigue_Campaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intrigue Campaign\">Intrigue Campaign</a>, as long as the characters realize that not every situation can be solved with combat. The heroes must rely on their powers of observation and deduction to move the story along, as well. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Intrigue_Heroes\">Intrigue Heroes</span></h3> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intrigue_Heroes\" title=\"Intrigue Heroes\">Intrigue Heroes</a></i> </p>\n <p>The galaxy is rife with intrigue. Every <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species</a>, corporation, planet, fiefdom, and other group has its own agendas and methods for getting its way. With so many interests jockeying for power, for good or for ill, nearly every individual can be considered to be involved in some form of conspiracy, if only as part of a demographic to be catered to or exploited. Even the hinterlands of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim\" title=\"The Outer Rim\">The Outer Rim</a> are home to plots for riches or power, meaning that only the most isolated creatures can truly pursue their destinies without influence. Heroes, however, are not such beings. They find themselves more enmeshed in the games of intrigue with every passing moment. This section explores how heroes who embrace those schemes and maneuvers can rise to become more than mere pawns- they can be vital parts of the board and, in some cases, the players who move the pieces in the first place. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Skill_Challenges\">Skill Challenges</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Skill_Challenges\" title=\"GoI Skill Challenges\">Skill Challenges</a></i> </p>\n <p>The <i>Star Wars</i> saga is full of examples of heroes doing amazing things. Such remarkable exploits often take place during shootouts, Lightsaber duels, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dogfights\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dogfights\">Dogfights</a> between X-Wings and TIE Fighters. But not every exciting scene in the films is about combat; many of them focus more on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills</a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents\" title=\"Talents\">Talents</a> that do not relate directly to fighting prowess. Chase sequences, stealthy investigations, tense negotiations, and other such scenes reflect the heroes' abilities to use their cunning, their creativity and their well-honed skills to achieve their goals. </p>\n <p>This chapter introduces the concept of Skill Challenges to the <i>Star Wars </i>roleplaying game. A Skill Challenge is a mechanical framework that Gamemasters can use to create exciting and interesting scenes in which the heroes use their <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills</a>, not their combat abilities, to accomplish a particular goal. In a Skill Challenge, the heroes make a series of related <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks\" title=\"Skill Checks\">Skill Checks</a> that combine to determine whether they face victory or defeat. A Skill Challenge can take the place of a combat encounter in an adventure or can augment a combat encounter by adding a skill-based element. </p>\n <p>Many scenes from the <i>Star Wars</i> films could be represented in a roleplaying game as Skill Challenges. The asteroid chase in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, the negotiation between Luke Skywalker and Jabba the Hutt in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, the Podrace in <i>The Phantom Menace</i>, Obi-Wan's investigation of the Jango Fett mystery in <i>Attack of the Clones</i>- all these are examples of sequences in which heroes use multiple <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills</a> to accomplish a task. Typically, a Skill Challenge represents a scene or a group of scenes that moves the plot forward through skill use rather than combat. </p>\n <p>This chapter teaches Gamemasters how to create their own Skill Challenges and run them in adventures. Players might want to familiarize themselves with the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Playing_Skill_Challenges\" title=\"Playing Skill Challenges\">Playing Skill Challenges</a> section, which provides tips on interacting with Skill Challenges and using them to create exciting, cinematic scenes. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Playing_Skill_Challenges\">Playing Skill Challenges</span></h3> \n <p>For players, Skill Challenges represent a chance not only to use your <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills</a> in a meaningful way, but also to have your heroes contribute to an exciting scene. Skill Challenges are great for fleshing out your characters, letting their personalities come to life in the actions they take outside of combat encounters. A Skill Challenge offers an opportunity to roleplay your characters' strengths, and perhaps even weaknesses, in a dynamic way. </p>\n <p>As a player, your responsibility in the Skill Challenge is to come up with creative actions that can help your allies achieve the goal of the challenge. When it is your turn, think of an action that is appropriate for your hero in that situation. If possible, the action should play to your hero's strengths and give you a chance to show off your character's areas of expertise. Describe the action to your Gamemaster, and, if the GM approves of the idea, make a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Skill Check\">Skill Check</a> (or another check that the GM calls for) to determine the result. Once each of your allies has had a chance to act, it will be your turn again, provided that the Skill Challenge has not ended. </p>\n <p>Over the course of the Skill Challenge, the situation might evolve. You might receive new information, the backdrop could change, or the goals could shift as the challenge progresses. Be sure to think about how your hero would react to the changing circumstances of the Skill Challenge, and come up with new and interesting things to do. Below are some tips to help you choose actions that will contribute to an exciting, dynamic scene. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Running_Skill_Challenges\">Running Skill Challenges</span></h3> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Running_Skill_Challenges\" title=\"Running Skill Challenges\">Running Skill Challenges</a></i> </p>\n <p>In many ways, a Skill Challenge is like any other encounter. It has opportunities for success and penalties for failure. It requires multiple heroes to participate and often has both obstacles and antagonists. However, whereas combat encounters require the heroes to use weapons or special attacks to achieve victory, a Skill Challenge requires them to use their <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills</a> and creativity to succeed. </p>\n <p>One of the most important points to remember is that a Skill Challenge, like a combat encounter, is meant to create and exciting scene or sequence of scenes in the tradition of the <i>Star Wars</i> films. A Skill Challenge should have the same tension and uncertainty as a combat encounter, with real consequences for success and failure. When running a Skill Challenge for players, you have many of the same responsibilities as when running a combat encounter: you must keep the game moving, ensure that the pace does not slow too much, encourage players to be creative and act cinematically, and adjudicate the rules of the challenge. </p>\n <p>The basic Skill Challenge mechanics are relatively simple. Over the course of the challenge, the heroes take actions that either succeed or fail. If the heroes accrue a set number of successes before a set number of failures, they succeed in the challenge. If they accrue too many failures, they fail the challenge. </p>\n <p>Of course, that description is a very simplified version of the mechanics; the rest of this section provides a step-by-step breakdown of the process used when the Gamemaster runs a Skill Challenge. Throughout this breakdown, examples walk you through a sample Skill Challenge based on the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor</a> Speeder Bike chase in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. The examples do not detail the entire sequence, but instead they highlight how elements of the Skill Challenge combine to create and exciting and iconic scene from <i>Star Wars</i> lore. The premise of the Skill Challenge is that the heroes have arrived on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor</a> and encountered a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout_Trooper\" title=\"Scout Trooper\">Scout Trooper</a> Patrol. Their goal is to make sure the scouts do not report back to their superiors and alert the Empire to the Rebel presence on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor</a>. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Designing_Skill_Challenges\">Designing Skill Challenges</span></h3> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Designing_Skill_Challenges\" title=\"Designing Skill Challenges\">Designing Skill Challenges</a></i> </p>\n <p>Designing a Skill Challenge is much like designing a combat encounter. As the Gamemaster, you determine the location of the Skill Challenge, the obstacles and antagonists that might play into the scene, several options for providing the heroes with variety, and the consequences of success or failure. Conceptually, Skill Challenges and combat encounters are similar, although they differ in execution. </p>\n <p>This section walks you through the creation of a Skill Challenge, from the initial concept to challenge effects that can be added to spice things up. By following these steps, you can create Skill Challenges that contribute to exciting scenes in the <i>Star Wars</i> tradition. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Equipment\">Equipment</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Equipment\" title=\"GoI Equipment\">Equipment</a></i> </p>\n <p>For most of the intrigue-savvy people of the galaxy, wits and secrecy are the two most valuable weapons in their arsenals. However, sometimes inherent ability and learned skills are only part of what it takes to maintain secrecy or manipulate one's enemies. From time to time, even the wisest conspirators must make use of the technology that the galaxy has to offer, although they often use those things in deceptive ways. For the master of intrigue, equipment and weapons are merely a means to an end, but one should always make sure to have the right tools for the job. </p>\n <p>Most equipment used by masters of intrigue is designed to either create or enhance deception, keep secrets a secret, reveal someone else's secrets, or protect the keeper of a secret from harm. For example, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Xerrol_Nightstinger\" title=\"Xerrol Nightstinger\">Xerrol Nightstinger</a>, which produces an invisible blaster bolt, creates deception by preventing observers from seeing where the shot comes from. Likewise, the same weapon can be used to keep a secret a secret by taking out someone who is doing too much snooping around. Most of the equipment and weapons in this chapter perform one of those four functions, but they do so in very different ways. </p>\n <p><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids\" title=\"Droids\">Droids</a> are always something of a risk in an intrigue-based campaign. On one hand, Droids are immune to many tricks that living beings are susceptible to. They often cannot be bribed, smooth talked, or deceived into revealing the information within their databanks. They are often more focused on their missions than are living beings, and and they are incapable of actively betraying someone thanks to their rigid programming. However, Droids also present a significant risk, in that someone with the right computer slicing skills can extract information from them. Moreover, Droids are often less capable of defending themselves and thinking creatively than their living counterparts, making it more likely that they will fall into enemy hands. </p>\n <p>Most of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles</a> presented in this chapter are designed to put more tools in the hands of the intrigue-minded player or villain. Scout ships with excellent sensor cloaks can make spying on the enemy easier, and many spies prefer vessels with low profiles over those that, while more defensible, are more likely to attract notice. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Intrigue_Campaigns\">Intrigue Campaigns</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Intrigue_Campaigns\" title=\"GoI Intrigue Campaigns\">Intrigue Campaigns</a></i> </p>\n <p>In addition to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force</a>, the galaxy is bound together by one other factor- intrigue. Republic Senators bluster and pontificate in the Senate Rotunda on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant</a> and engage in secret deals behind closed doors. Criminal masterminds scheme for profit and power, sometimes behind a facade of legality and legitimacy. Corporate CEOs try to maximize profits and expand their market shares while trying to force the competition out of business. Even a simple avenue in an obscure settlement on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine\" title=\"Tatooine\">Tatooine</a> can hold a wealth of secret deals, power struggles, and tangled relationships- all potential hooks for adventure. </p>\n <p>An Intrigue Campaign can occur during any <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Era_of_Play\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Era of Play\">Era of Play</a>, so Gamemasters have full leeway in when and where the game can take place. During <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Old Republic Era\">The Old Republic Era</a>, corporate power expands and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith</a> operate openly. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rise_of_the_Empire_Era\" title=\"The Rise of the Empire Era\">The Rise of the Empire Era</a> is thick with intrigue, espionage, and intelligence gathering, not only between the Republic and the Separatists, but also among neutral or otherwise unaligned planets and organizations- each with its own motives and agendas. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Times\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Dark Times\">The Dark Times</a> are rife with paranoia and treachery, with the heroes facing the unbelievable might of the Empire. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Rebellion Era\">The Rebellion Era</a> pits <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance</a> against Imperial forces for years, leaving tremendous room for any intrigues the Gamemaster and players develop. </p>\n <p>In an Intrigue Campaign, the heroes delve into the tangled skein of intrigue to foil plots and expose the truth. As with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fringe_Campaigns\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fringe Campaigns\">Fringe Campaigns</a>, the heroes do not have to be the most law-abiding or altruistic individuals, and in fact, characters who strictly adhere to legal behavior can derail a campaign to a certain degree, since breaking and entering, assassination, extortion, and illegal slicing are standard themes. In most cases, the heroes are the underdogs, going up against powerful political organizations, corporations, or criminal networks. Secrecy and duplicity are the tools of an Intrigue Campaign, and even trust can be employed as a weapon. Nothing is as it seems in this type of campaign, as layers are peeled away to reveal deeper, darker secrets threatening the safety of the galaxy and the balance of good and evil. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Factions_and_Organizations\">Factions and Organizations</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Factions_and_Organizations\" title=\"GoI Factions and Organizations\">Factions and Organizations</a></i> </p>\n <p>In the <i>Star Wars</i> galaxy, war is not always obvious and in the open. While the skies are full of fighters and blaster reports echo in the streets, more subtle combatants watch from the shadows. A Rebel deep within the ranks of the Imperial Army can do as much for the war effort as a fighter pilot on the front line. In fact, they might do more than the pilot, because if they do not \"Lose\" a report from their <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Intelligence\" title=\"Imperial Intelligence\">Imperial Intelligence</a> counterpart inserted inserted into the staff of Admiral Ackbar, the pilot could be blown to pieces by a much larger, much better prepared force guarding the convoy they are sent to raid. </p>\n <p>As the Empire and the Alliance struggle for control of the galaxy, leaders of noble houses curry favor with one side or the other, all the while hedging their bets. No matter which side wins, the nobles plan to retain their wealth and power. </p>\n <p>The same is true in the boardrooms of the galactic megacorporations. Backroom talks are organized with those who have the Emperor's ear, while security operatives are dispatched to either befriend or defend against the Alliance. The companies exist to supply the galaxy with goods and to turn a profit, and they need to protect their ability to do this during both war and peace. </p>\n <p>Small stellar nations on the Empire's borders, such as those of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chiss_Ascendancy\" title=\"The Chiss Ascendancy\">The Chiss Ascendancy</a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hapes_Consortium\" title=\"The Hapes Consortium\">The Hapes Consortium</a>, need to secure their safety during and after the conflict. And while Imperial troops and Alliance soldiers blast away at each other, double agents, corporate spies, and emissaries from noble houses and independent governments whisper to one another and exchange information in their out-of-the-way corners. War in the shadows can be every bit as exciting as the one being waged in the open. </p>\n <p>This chapter presents organizations that embody some of the intrigues that can unfold in a <i>Star Wars</i> campaign. The members of those organizations can be the heroes' friends, foes, or both, depending on the objectives to be achieved. Although most parts of the Empire and the Alliance are as clearly contrasted as black and white, many of the groups in this chapter defy such easy categorization. </p>\n <p>They say to keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When it comes to the organizations and people in this chapter, the heroes might not be able to tell the difference. </p> \n <h2><span id=\"Nyriaan,_World_of_Intrigue\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nyriaan.2C_World_of_Intrigue\">Nyriaan, World of Intrigue</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Nyriaan,_World_of_Intrigue\" title=\"GoI Nyriaan, World of Intrigue\">Nyriaan, World of Intrigue</a></i> </p>\n <p>The planet Nyriaan is the center of a struggle as turbulent as the planet's violent atmosphere.

Controlled by none and coveted by many, Nyriaan is a dangerous planet steeped in intrigue and conspiracy. </p>\n <p>Nyriaan is covered in a dense cloud layer that makes landing on the planet without assistance challenging. Moreover, the planet's atmosphere makes sending data and other communication by any means difficult, effectively walling off the planet from the rest of the galaxy. The high demand for Nyriaan's resources, combined with the difficulty that outsiders face when attempting to intervene in the planet's affairs, creates a situation where only those on the planet can truly influence the flow of resources to the galaxy, and it puts a great deal of power in the hands of those who control the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Madilon\" title=\"Madilon\">Madilon</a> mines on the planet's surface. </p>\n <p>By the same token, the inhabitants of Nyriaan are caught in the midst of a constant struggle between the various factions seeking to control the planet's natural resources. Daily life on Nyriaan is filled with political maneuvering, infighting between factions, espionage, sabotage, and the scheming machinations of the most cunning minds in the galaxy. Although tensions on Nyriaan rarely erupt into full-scale, violent conflict, the intrigue runs so thick on the planet that anyone- and everyone- is entangled in some scheme or plot. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Intrigue_Encounters\">Intrigue Encounters</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Intrigue_Encounters\" title=\"GoI Intrigue Encounters\">Intrigue Encounters</a></i> </p>\n <p>This chapter is intended for Gamemasters and contains several mini-adventures ideally suited for heroes of intrigue. If you are a player, you probably should skip this chapter and wait for your Gamemaster to spring these adventures on you and the other players in your group. </p>\n <p>Occasionally, heroes take a tangent that their Gamemaster had not planned for, or the Gamemaster needs to fill a few hours of play with an entertaining diversion from the main plot. The Gamemaster can improvise something, but, when he or she is at a loss for a scenario (or is just pressed for time), a mini-adventure might fit the bill. </p>\n <p>The mini-adventures presented here cover a range of themes and challenge levels, including stakeouts, infiltrations, and the extraction of deep-cover spies from behind enemy lines. Each mini-adventure includes background on the events and challenges presented in the scenario, which the Gamemaster can use to construct a few \"Off-the-Cuff\" situations or as a jumping-off point for future encounters. </p>\n <p>In addition, each mini-adventure also features a fully developed tactical encounter designed to serve as the climax of the scenario. The Gamemaster can use these encounters as written, alter the details to play to the heroes' strengths, or completely redesign them to fit the needs of the campaign. The Gamemaster can also reference these encounters when designing his or her own mini-adventures and scenarios. </p>\n <p>These mini-adventures are designed to cater to different heroes' abilities, as well as the players' interests, within the realm of intrigue. For example, action-oriented heroes should appreciate \"<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/My_Enemy%27s_Enemy\" title=\"My Enemy's Enemy\">My Enemy's Enemy</a>,\" while stealthy and tech-savvy heroes will like \"<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arms_Dealers_Beware\" title=\"Arms Dealers Beware\">Arms Dealers Beware</a>.\" Heroes hoping to show off their espionage skills should enjoy \"<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Betrayal_at_Cloud_City\" title=\"Betrayal at Cloud City\">Betrayal at Cloud City</a>\" and \"<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Double_Down\" title=\"Double Down\">Double Down</a>.\" Similarly, \"<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Opportunity_Knocks\" title=\"Opportunity Knocks\">Opportunity Knocks</a>\" is aimed at heroic nobles, and the group's fast-talking con artist should find that \"<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shooting_Trouble\" title=\"Shooting Trouble\">Shooting Trouble</a>\" makes good use of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception\" title=\"Deception\">Deception</a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion\" title=\"Persuasion\">Persuasion</a>. Each mini-adventure in this chapter gives heroes of all <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Classes\" title=\"Heroic Classes\">Heroic Classes</a> a time to shine, even if the scenario is not aimed specifically at their competencies. </p>\n <p>Although these mini-adventures are designed to be completely independent of one another, common threads run through all of them, allowing them to be strung together and run as a sort of \"Sub-Campaign\" within the main campaign. How they are used is purely up to the Gamemaster's discretion. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Perfect_Storm\">The Perfect Storm</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_The_Perfect_Storm\" title=\"GoI The Perfect Storm\">The Perfect Storm</a></i> </p>\n <p>\"The Perfect Storm\" is an adventure for the <i>Star Wars Roleplaying Game</i>.

Following his capture, the Republic begins an offensive that drives the forces of the Sith back, eventually shattering the Krath forces, routing <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians\" title=\"The Mandalorians\">The Mandalorians</a>, and scattering the few remaining Sith to the farthest reaches of the galaxy. Crippled by the prolonged war effort, the Republic cannot pursue the Sith forces, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban\" title=\"Korriban\">Korriban</a> remains under Sith control. </p> \n <h3><span id=\"The_Restoration_Period_(3,995-3,966_BBY)\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Restoration_Period_.283.2C995-3.2C966_BBY.29\">The Restoration Period (3,995-3,966 BBY)</span></h3> \n <p>The Great Sith War is a devastating event that causes more damage than any conflict since the Great Hyperspace War a thousand years before. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Order\">The Jedi Order</a>, greatly depleted, turns inward to heal itself, increasing the responsibilities of a Republic that is barely standing. Piracy is rampant. Trade routes, which had been blazed and developed over centuries at enormous cost, require redevelopment at nearly every stop. Nearly one quarter of the civilized worlds in the Republic have been devastated by the conflict, and most worlds are left on their own to rebuild as the Republic's resources are depleted. </p>\n <p>With the Republic itself on the verge of collapse for over a decade following the war, a group of politicians put into motion a series of events that eventually restores the Republic to its prior strength. By guaranteeing the various corporations throughout the galaxy safe passage and trade along the space lanes in exchange for commercial investment in the Republic's infrastructure, the Republic is able to rebuild its military and provide much-needed goods to the devastated people of the galaxy. Hyperspace explorers once again begin scouting the galaxy in earnest, discovering newer and safer routes. Across the galaxy, planets begin to rebuild, commerce resumes, and the Republic's military might is reestablished. </p>\n <p>The enemies of the Republic are far from inactive during this time, however. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith</a> who fled back to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban\" title=\"Korriban\">Korriban</a> bide their time and keep a low profile, while those who had fled to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions</a> practice their dark arts in secret. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians\" title=\"The Mandalorians\">The Mandalorians</a> continue their nomadic existence, rebuilding their ranks and continuing the Mandalorian tradition.

The nomadic mercenary army begins testing the rebuilt Republic's defenses by raiding <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Outer Rim\">Outer Rim</a> worlds and interrupting trade routes, forcing the Republic to push its resources further than they were prepared for.

As <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians\" title=\"The Mandalorians\">The Mandalorians</a> launch focused strikes against the Republic's poorly defended targets, chaos spreads throughout a Republic that fears the devastation of The Great Sith War. </p>\n <p>After a series of military failures, the Republic once again turns to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Order\">The Jedi Order</a> for aid. Having been hit the hardest by the casualties of The Great Sith War, the Jedi Order refuses, at first, to join the military effort. However, among the Jedi are a few who cannot stand by while the Mandalorian invasion batters at the Republic's defenses, including a powerful Jedi called Revan. Revan leads other like-minded Jedi into battle once more, despite the Order's directive that they should not be involved. After victories against <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians\" title=\"The Mandalorians\">The Mandalorians</a>, even more Jedi flock to Revan's call. Over time, the Republic cedes control of many of its military assets to the Jedi, and the Mandalorian Wars begin in full. </p>\n <p>As battles rage across the galaxy, Mandalorians win victories against the Republic and the Republic reclaims territories lost to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians\" title=\"The Mandalorians\">The Mandalorians</a>. Quickly, Jedi such as Revan and their apprentice, Malak, become war heroes. After years of violent conflict, the Republic finally manages to repel <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians\" title=\"The Mandalorians\">The Mandalorians</a> with a devastating victory at <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Malachor_V\" title=\"Malachor V\">Malachor V</a>. There, the Mandalorian forces are nearly wiped out. The surviving Mandalorians go into exile, and the Jedi are heralded as saviors of the Republic. Surprisingly, though, Revan and Malak gather the remnants of their fleets and flee into <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions</a>.

Darth Revan and Darth Malak, now Dark Lords of the Sith, quickly reclaim the planet <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban\" title=\"Korriban\">Korriban</a>, seize control of a large swath of Republic space and declare themselves the leaders of a new Sith Empire. While in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions</a>, Revan and Malak steep themselves in the teaching of those Sith who had been defeated in The Great Sith War, and empowered by the Jedi victories in The Mandalorian Wars they set out to conquer the galaxy. The Sith military continue their assaults on Republic worlds, conquering one planet after another, embroiling the galaxy in conflict once more. </p>\n <p>Even though the Republic military that travel with Revan and Malak have long since been corrupted by <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side</a>, upon their return they are joined by many other Republic loyalists. Former comrades-in-arms now fight one another in desperate battles. A Republic already damaged by The Mandalorian Wars struggles to fight off a new enemy made up of their former allies. Many worlds voluntarily join the Sith, believing that because Revan and Malak saved them from <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians\" title=\"The Mandalorians\">The Mandalorians</a> they are more fit to lead than the Republic. Revan recruits to their cause those Jedi who will follow them, and attacks the rest, forcing <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi</a> to choose between joining <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith</a> or death. </p>\n <p>A Jedi strike force alters the course of the Jedi Civil War by boarding a Starship controlled by Revan and Malak, engaging the two Sith Lords in combat. Malak turns on his master, and Revan is struck down, only to be saved by a young Jedi named Bastila Shan. A captive of the Jedi, Revan's memory is erased and their identity rebuilt as a loyal agent of the Republic. This ruse does not last long, and soon Revan rediscovers who they are and what they had done. Rejecting their former self and embracing the way of the light, Revan retraces their steps and discovers a massive artifact known as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Star_Forge\" title=\"The Star Forge\">The Star Forge</a>, aboard which they duel and vanquish their former apprentice, Malak, ending The Jedi Civil War. </p> \n <h3><span id=\"The_Dark_Wars_(3,955-3,951_BBY)\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Dark_Wars_.283.2C955-3.2C951_BBY.29\">The Dark Wars (3,955-3,951 BBY)</span></h3> \n <p>After Darth Malak's defeat at the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rakata_Prime\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rakata Prime\">Rakata Prime</a>, the forces of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith</a> fall into chaos. Retreating from the continued attacks by the Republic, the Sith Empire fragments into hundreds of smaller territories ruled over by Sith warlords. The few remaining Dark Lords of the Sith fight with one another over scraps of their Empire, damaging themselves as much as the Republic. While the Republic rebuilds it's forces, the Sith seem content to eradicate themselves, as each Dark Lord of the Sith becomes determined to be the new leader of the Sith Empire. </p>\n <p>Though <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith</a> are at war with themselves, a small number of Sith Lords band together to form new leadership for their crumbling Empire.

However, these plans are dashed when a Jedi survivor slays all three members of the Sith Triumvirate and helps eliminate the last of the Sith threat.

As a result, Lightsabers required large power cells, some larger than a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human</a> hand, to function at full capacity. These power cells were worn on the belt or on the back, and were connected to the hilt of the Archaic Lightsaber via a long, slender cord. </p>\n <p>Around the same time that Pulse-Wave weapons were phased out in favor of modern blasters, Lightsabers underwent a design revolution that miniaturized the power cells required to fuel the energy blade. With the development of this new technology, the Jedi devised methods of Lightsaber creation that integrated these drastically smaller power cells into the hilt of the Lightsaber, eliminating the need for the external <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack\" title=\"Power Pack\">Power Pack</a>. With this revolution, the Archaic Lightsaber design was almost entirely abandoned. </p>\n <p>The Archaic <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack\" title=\"Power Pack\">Power Pack</a> has one advantage over its modern analogs. The fact that the Archaic Lightsaber is physically attached to the Archaic <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack\" title=\"Power Pack\">Power Pack</a> by a power cord means that the weapon doesn't go far, or roll away on its own when dropped, though any kind of force applied to the power cord (such as a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disarm\" title=\"Disarm\">Disarm</a> attempt) immediately disconnects the Archaic Lightsaber from its power source. </p>\n <p>An Archaic Lightsaber is somewhat weaker than the classic <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_(Weapon)\" title=\"Lightsaber (Weapon)\">Lightsaber</a> due to the lack of a sophisticated power supply and the distance of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell\" title=\"Energy Cell\">Energy Cell</a> from the Archaic Lightsaber's main body. </p>\n <p>An Archaic Lightsaber requires a special&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack\" title=\"Power Pack\">Power Pack</a>&nbsp;to operate (costing 600 credits, but it lasts almost indefinitely). </p>    \n</div>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{"0":{"override":false,"value":"2d6","key":"damage"},"1":{"override":false,"value":"Energy","key":"damageType"},"2":{"override":false,"value":"Slashing","key":"damageType"}},"choices":[],"modes":{"0":{"modes":{},"name":"Self-Built","attributes":{"0":{"override":false,"value":1,"key":"toHitModifier"}}}},"providedItems":{},"payload":"","cost":"2,000","weight":"1 Kilogram","availability":"Rare","size":"Medium","type":"","subtype":"Lightsabers","categories":[],"items":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"activeModes":[],"weapon":{},"source":"Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"cY0q8u4KzzwaU7Z3"}

Generally, the license is not expensive, and obtaining it has few if any additional legal requirements.</li> \n  <li><b>Restricted: </b>Only specifically qualified individuals or organizations are technically allowed to own the object. However, the real obstacles to ownership are time and money; anyone with sufficient patience and cash can eventually acquire the necessary license.</li> \n  <li><b>Military: </b>The object is sold primarily to legitimate police and military organizations. A military rating is essentially the same as restricted, except that manufacturers and dealers are generally under tight government scrutiny and are therefore especially wary of selling to private individuals.</li> \n  <li><b>Illegal: </b>The object is illegal in all but specific, highly regulated circumstances.</li>\n </ul> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Getting_A_License\">Getting A License</span></h2> \n <p>To get a license, you must pay the fee required to file the application.

On a failure, you spend a number of days as listed in the Time Required column, but you are not granted the license and your application fee is lost.

Energy Shields typically have 5 charges, and energy shields can only be activated once per encounter (the stress on the shield generator causes the device to overload otherwise, so the manufacturers build in failsafes to prevent such an occurrence).\n\nEach activation consumes one charge and lasts through the end of the encounter. An Energy Shield only protects against weapons that deal Energy damage; a weapon that deals any other type of damage bypasses the shield's SR entirely.\n\nThe Shield Rating provided by the Energy Shield determines the Energy Shield's price, as well as the type of Armor Proficiency feat required to operate the Energy Shield without penalty (Armor Proficiency (Light), Armor Proficiency (Medium), or Armor Proficiency (Heavy)).\n\nEnergy Shields come in three varieties: Light, Medium, and Heavy. Each Energy Shield type corresponds to an armor type (Light is Light Armor, Medium is Medium Armor, and Heavy is Heavy Armor). A character with an active Energy Shield without the relevant Armor Proficiency feat takes a -5 penalty to their Reflex Defense, and the wearer is denied its Dexterity bonus to their Reflex Defense (though they still gain the benefits of the Energy Shield).\n\nRegardless of whether or not the character is proficient with the Energy Shield, the character always takes the Armor Check Penalty associated with the Energy Shield while it is activated. Additionally, each type of Energy Shield imposes its Maximum Dexterity Bonus restriction only when activated, not when worn and inert.\n\nAn Energy Shield can be added to a suit of armor as an Armor Accessory.

Our first exposure to the Star Wars saga began with the war between <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance</a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire\" title=\"The Galactic Empire\">The Galactic Empire</a>, and the stories of heroes from a galaxy far, far away almost fall against the backdrop of armed conflict. From the ancient Great Hyperspace War to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Civil_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Civil War\">The Jedi Civil War</a>, from the Clone Wars through <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith-Imperial_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Sith-Imperial War\">The Sith-Imperial War</a>, time has been marked in the galaxy not by its long-standing ears of peace, but by its tranquility-shattering periods of war. Nearly every great tale of heroism and villainy comes with galaxy-spanning conflict as a part of its story, and the same goes for the stories of heroes in the <i>Star Wars Roleplaying Game</i>. </p>\n <p><i>Galaxy at War</i> is dedicated to bringing the same kinds of epic conflict to your adventures and campaigns. Inside these articles you will find a virtual toolbox full of material that you can use to give your adventures a backdrop fitting for a setting focused on warfare. <i>Galaxy at War</i> is all about bringing a strong militaristic feeling to your adventures, whether your heroes are part of a military unit engaged in war or simply swept up as unwilling pawns in a galactic conflict. With <i>Galaxy at War</i>, you should be able to take a campaign set during any of the wars throughout the galaxy's history and create a campaign that makes your heroes feel like they are directly contributing to the outcome of that conflict. </p>\n <p>Players using <i>Galaxy at War</i> will find inspiration not only for their heroes' origins, but also for their <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destinies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destinies\">Destinies</a>. <i>Galaxy at War</i> helps players get into a military mindset, so that they can bring their heroes (Soldiers and otherwise) to life. Players with characters of any class in a war-themed campaign should find plenty of things to use in <i>Galaxy at War</i>, including new ideas for character histories, weapons, and equipment. Moreover, these articles can be a great inspiration for an entire group of players looking to find ways to bring their heroes together and form bonds that will last through an entire campaign; nothing ensures loyalty like going into the fire together and coming out the other side alive. </p>\n <p>Gamemasters will find not only sample adventures but also advice for creating and maintaining military adventures and campaigns. <i>Galaxy at War</i> can serve as a tool kit for putting together military adventures, from the pre-mission briefing all the way through the post-combat breakdown and mission analysis. <i>Galaxy at War</i> provides not only advice for running military-themed campaigns (Including the archetypal military campaign, in which the heroes play characters who are members of the Imperial military), but also provides small details and subtle touches, like military jargon and NPC personality qualities, that can help GMs transform adventures from standard mission-based games into exciting and in-depth war epics. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Military_Heroes\">Military Heroes</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article:<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_Military_Heroes\" title=\"GaW Military Heroes\"> Military Heroes</a></i> </p>\n <p>For over a thousand generations <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Order\">The Jedi Order</a> has guarded the peace throughout the galaxy. Even so, key eras of the <i>Star Wars</i> saga are ravaged by war, offering Gamemasters opportunities for campaigns focusing on warfare and the military. The heroes of a military campaign fight in battles, but they also can be the characters around which the war turns. In many cases, the actions of such heroes not only decide battles but also determine the fate of entire systems and sectors. Billions of lives hang in the balance, and the heroes' actions can determine the final outcome of entire wars. The heroes of a military campaign are not simply combatants, they are agents of destiny. </p>\n <p>The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier\" title=\"Soldier\">Soldier</a> class is well suited for a military campaign. <i>Galaxy at War</i> introduces new options specifically geared for characters who take levels in the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier\" title=\"Soldier\">Soldier</a> class, including those who only have a few levels of the class. Additionally, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier\" title=\"Soldier\">Soldier</a> class encompases a wide variety of archetypes within the military theme: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soldiers\">Soldiers</a> can be covert-ops warriors, military police, officers-in-training, mercenaries, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Starfighter\">Starfighter</a> pilots, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gunners\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gunners\">Gunners</a>, martial arts masters, and much, much more. <i>Galaxy at War</i> helps players and Gamemasters use the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier\" title=\"Soldier\">Soldier</a> class to greater potential, illuminating new paths for combat archetypes. </p>\n <p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soldiers\">Soldiers</a> are not the only participants in warfare. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nobles\">Nobles</a> recruit and command troops, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scoundrels\">Scoundrels</a> raid supply lines and ambush unsuspecting troops; <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scouts\">Scouts</a> prepare entire armies for the battles they are about to face; and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi\" title=\"Jedi\">Jedi</a> bring the power of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force</a> to combat. Heroes of these classes can find new <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents\" title=\"Talents\">Talents</a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats\" title=\"Feats\">Feats</a> in this chapter, and elsewhere in <i>Galaxy at War</i> can find new material to hive heroes a distinctly military edge. Heroes of all classes are affected by the tides of war, and <i>Galaxy at War</i> presents several new options that reflect how involvement in galaxywide war changes those characters. </p>\n <p>Much of the discussion in <i>Galaxy at War</i> uses the word \"Military\" to represent a general theme of a faction involved in a war. The term is not reserved only for organized factions such as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic\" title=\"The Galactic Republic\">The Galactic Republic</a> or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire\" title=\"The Galactic Empire\">The Galactic Empire</a>, but also covers any paramilitary or combat-oriented group. Highly organized and militant pirate groups, mercenary bands, support forces, and even individual adventuring parties all fall under this banner. Military heroes are not required to be signed up for the armed forces of a major government, although typically they are members of an organized force with a rank structure and protocols of behavior focusing on combat and warfare. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Military_Heroes_2\">Military Heroes</span></h3> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Military_Heroes\" title=\"Military Heroes\">Military Heroes</a></i> </p>\n <p>Life on the battlefield can be intense, terrifying, exhilarating, or short. It can even be all of these at once. Most galactic citizens take food, shelter, and safety for granted, but in combat- from simple skirmishes between rival forces to galaxy-shaking conflicts such as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorian_Wars\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Mandalorian Wars\">The Mandalorian Wars</a>, the Clone Wars, or the Galactic Civil War- those features become luxuries. Those who learn to adapt to harsh and unforgiving conditions survive to fight another day. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hardware\">Hardware</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_Hardware\" title=\"GaW Hardware\">Hardware</a></i> </p>\n <p>Weapons and hardware make the soldier. For thousands of years, blasters are the dominant weapon technology used by soldiers, mercenaries, and warriors alike. However, a bewildering array of weapons and armor are used throughout the galaxy, from cutting edge to primitive. A soldier might face sophisticated fighters with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Missile_Launchers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Missile Launchers\">Missile Launchers</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Armor\" title=\"Battle Armor\">Battle Armor</a>, and the latest in blaster and ion technology, or primitive savages wearing little more than bone armor and wielding <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bows\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bows\">Bows</a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Spears\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spears\">Spears</a>. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Advanced_Cybernetics\">Advanced Cybernetics</span></h3> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Cybernetics\" title=\"Advanced Cybernetics\">Advanced Cybernetics</a></i> </p>\n <p>Basic rules for cybernetic replacement parts and their implantation can be found in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cybernetic_Devices\" title=\"Cybernetic Devices\">Cybernetic Devices</a>. The following section details several new cybernetics options that can be included in any campaign. </p>\n <p>A creature with a cybernetic part is susceptible to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ion\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ion\">Ion</a> damage as though it was a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Droid\">Droid</a>.

Unless the characters pack serious firepower, most <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles</a> can easily shrug off the damage caused by hand-held blasters. In addition, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Systems\" title=\"Weapon Systems\">Weapon Systems</a> are usually able to mow down an entire adventuring group in short order. </p>\n <p>The rules provided here transform <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles</a> from killing machines into more manageable terrain objects that can augment an encounter rather than derail it. These effects can be offensive or defensive and can be used by the Gamemaster either to help or to hinder the heroes. </p>\n <p>Battlefield Effects are special auras that can be applied to any nonstarship <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vehicle\">Vehicle</a> that meets the prerequisites. A Battlefield Effect lasts until the end of the Vehicle's next turn. A Vehicle can only have one Battlefield Effect at a time, and the effect is determined prior to an encounter. Giving a Battlefield Effect to a Vehicle requires no modifications to its weapons, armor, or other systems. </p>\n <p>To use a Battlefield Effect, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Commander\" title=\"Commander\">Commander</a> of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vehicle\">Vehicle</a> takes a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Standard Action\">Standard Action</a> and the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vehicle\">Vehicle</a> can make no attacks until the start of the Commander's next turn. This produces an area of effect as described in each Battlefield Effect's description. Characters or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles</a> must be completely within the area of effect to be affected by the Battlefield Effect. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gear_Requisition\">Gear Requisition</span></h3> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gear_Requisition\" title=\"Gear Requisition\">Gear Requisition</a></i> </p>\n <p>Training, equipping, and arming a soldier in a professional army costs tens of thousands of credits. Soldiers rarely carry their personal gear and weapons into battle and instead rely on their military units to outfit them with the gear necessary for battle. In addition to three square meals a day and a cot, one advantage to serving in a regular army or mercenary unit is access to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons\" title=\"Weapons\">Weapons</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment\" title=\"Equipment\">Equipment</a>, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles</a> that are beyond the reaches of civilians. A well-equipped and well-funded army or mercenary outfit is assumed to have gear, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles</a>, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids\" title=\"Droids\">Droids</a> appropriate to their faction and era. In most cases, the average soldier has access to gear and equipment far beyond what would normally be available to a character by using the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Money\" title=\"Money\">Money</a> system. </p>\n <p>Gear Requisition is a set of optional rules that replaces that standard system of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Money\" title=\"Money\">Money</a>. The Gear Requisition system gives players in a <i>Galaxy at War</i> campaign access to bigger and better weapons, armor, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles</a>, and even <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starships\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Starships\">Starships</a> that would exceed the limits of their personal wealth. However, the equipment that the heroes requisition does not belong to them and must be returned to the army or mercenary company's quartermaster at the end of the adventure. When the heroes are off duty or not otherwise working on behalf of their units, they must rely on their own weapons and gear to survive. </p>\n <p>Requisitioned Gear is distinct from gear assigned for a specific mission. Requisitioned Gear can be used in any way that the hero sees fit, just like personal gear. Heroes who requisition gear for a mission might receive additional unique, mission-specific items or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles</a> that would otherwise exceed their requisition budget. However, gear assigned for a mission must be used in accordance with the mission's parameters. A soldier is both responsible and accountable for gear assigned as part of a mission, and reckless endangerment or destruction of this equipment could result in harsh discipline. For example, the heroes might be ordered to transport an experimental weapon to the battlefield, but the weapon is not theirs to deploy unless given direct permission. Also, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starships\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Starships\">Starships</a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles</a> that ferry the heroes to and from locations and do not otherwise accompany the heroes after drop off are not considered part of a requisition budget. </p>\n <p>If you utilize this system in your campaign, then the heroes should receive only one-half the usual rewards in credits that they would otherwise gain (See <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gamemastering\" title=\"Gamemastering\">Gamemastering</a>). Heroes in a military-themed campaign are fighting for the prestige and glory, not the credits, and if they choose to leave their military organization, they discover that life as a civilian comes without access to the best gear, weapons, and gadgets that soldiers enjoy. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rank_and_Privilege\">Rank and Privilege</span></h3> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rank_and_Privilege\" title=\"Rank and Privilege\">Rank and Privilege</a></i> </p>\n <p>A hero who serves in an army, a planetary defense organization, or a mercenary group is given a rank here called a title. With a title comes authority to give orders, access to equipment and personnel, and increased pay. However, the greater a hero's title is, the greater are the accountability, responsibilities, and demands placed on him or her. The <i>Star Wars Roleplaying Game</i> is about action, however, not administrative paperwork or Boards of Inquiry, so heroes in the game are allowed more leeway than actual members of the military would ever hope for. A title is usually indicative of character level and experience, but a title can be based on social status and other noncombat-oriented factors. Heroes often receive orders from officers who are superior in rank but considerably lower in level-sometimes having only <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nonheroic\" title=\"Nonheroic\">Nonheroic</a> levels. </p>\n <p>The Rank and Privilege system is based on and is compatible with the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Organization\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Organization\">Organization</a> system described in the <i><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Force Unleashed Campaign Guide\">Force Unleashed Campaign Guide</a></i>, and it also stands on its own as an independent optional system. Gamemasters using both these systems should determine the scale, organization type, and positive and negative criteria for specific military organizations in their campaigns. </p>\n <p>The Rank and Privilege system provided here gives a character's title and the corresponding additional in-game abilities and bonus for requisitioning equipment (See <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gear_Requisition\" title=\"Gear Requisition\">Gear Requisition</a>). As a player advances in title, he or she also gains access to additional benefits. With title also comes authority, and as such, heroes add the appropriate Command Bonus score to any <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion\" title=\"Persuasion\">Persuasion</a> checks when dealing with members of their military organization (See below). </p>\n <p>Military organizations follow a strict chain of command, with clear regulations on rank, responsibility, and authority of each soldier in its command. Soldiers are expected to follow the orders without question, and officers expect that their orders are carried out quickly and efficiently by those under their command. Depending on the military organization, era, and even duty post, soldiers can advance rapidly through the ranks or can make themselves career foot soldiers or noncommissioned officers. The table below includes the most common ranks found in military groups throughout the galaxy. Depending on the branch, some of the titles might be different or might not exist at all. For simplicity's sake, the titles given apply to both ground and naval forces. Gamemasters are free to alter the titles as needed. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Military_Campaigns\">Military Campaigns</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article:<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_Military_Campaigns\" title=\"GaW Military Campaigns\"> Military Campaigns</a></i> </p>\n <p>Military Campaigns can portray the heroics of a high-flying <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Starfighter\">Starfighter</a> squadron or the trials and tribulations of a special-forces unit wallowing in the mud. The most important difference between a Military Campaign and a more conventional one is the mood and tone. Military Campaigns are structured. Even though the morality of the conflict might be unclear, the objectives are well defined. </p>\n <p>Winning a war requires teamwork, planning, and the skills to get the job done. Discipline is also important, because it provides a structure for the military machine. Even the lowliest trooper is expected to follow orders. If the trooper refuses to do so, the ripples of the insubordination can be felt even in the highest echelons. </p>\n <p>This chapter explains how to establish the necessary tone and mood of a Military Campaign and how to convey to the heroes that they are a part of a conflict that is much larger than any individual solder. In addition, you can learn about military characters and what makes them tick. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Imperial_Campaign\">The Imperial Campaign</span></h3> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Imperial_Campaign\" title=\"The Imperial Campaign\">The Imperial Campaign</a></i> </p>\n <p>During <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Rebellion Era\">The Rebellion Era</a>, the largest, most powerful, and most cohesive military force is controlled by the Empire. The increased militarization started by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during the Clone Wars is enhanced by fierce nationalism, xenophobia, and fears of destabilization. Constant warfare keeps the Imperial military in a heightened state of readiness for decades, and insurgent uprisings on a number of worlds sharpen the skills of Imperial officers and the troops that serve beneath them. </p>\n <p>Thousands of military vessels crewed by millions of loyal Imperial troops cruise space in defense of the Empire. They possess the best weapons and equipment available, along with the tenacity and training to use them to the best effect. In addition, Emperor Palpatine- a charismatic and seemingly selfless leader- has made it his goal to see that their way of life is not tarnished by corruption, terrorism, or the threat of primitive and debauched non-<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human</a> societies. </p>\n <p>How can they lose? </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Battlefield_Encounter_Tool_Kit\">Battlefield Encounter Tool Kit</span></h3> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Battlefield_Encounter_Tool_Kit\" title=\"Battlefield Encounter Tool Kit\">Battlefield Encounter Tool Kit</a></i> </p>\n <p>The battlefields of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe are many and varied, so the tactics of enemies and allies should not be limited to routine assault or defense. Methods of warfare can be codified and civil or brutal and barbaric, but the aim is always the same- victory. When the price of victory becomes secondary to victory itself, all bets are off. </p>\n <p>This Battlefield Encounter Tool Kit features various rules and options for spicing up the battlefields of your military campaigns. Some of the rules presented here might prove deadly to unprepared heroes. You are advised to use them with care. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mission_Generator\">Mission Generator</span></h3> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Generator\" title=\"Mission Generator\">Mission Generator</a></i> </p>\n <p>You might have a clear idea of the types of missions you want to send the heroes on. However, the Mission Generator can help to formulate a basic concept from which you can extrapolate more concrete details for a specific mission. To use the generator, roll a d20 and consult the table below. Each Mission type is briefly described in their respective section, along with criteria to determine Mission success. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Military_Units\">Military Units</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_Military_Units\" title=\"GaW Military Units\">Military Units</a></i> </p>\n <p>Many will claim that wars are fought by individual soldiers, and that a single person's contribution can turn the tides of battles and even of entire wars. That may be true, but typically wars area carried out not by individuals, but by factions. Within most conflicts, those factions are broken down into even smaller groups, often known as Military Units. This chapter details fifteen unique Military Units drawn from across the breadth of the <i>Star Wars</i> saga, from the ancient days of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Sith_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Great Sith War\">The Great Sith War</a> all the way up through the fight against the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong\" title=\"Yuuzhan Vong\">Yuuzhan Vong</a> invaders. </p>\n <p>Some units are part of a larger military structure, but still retain a great deal of autonomy. Although organizations such as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Katarn_Commandos\" title=\"The Katarn Commandos\">The Katarn Commandos</a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wraith_Squadron\" title=\"Wraith Squadron\">Wraith Squadron</a> answer to their New Republic and Galactic Alliance superiors, they still choose their own missions, create their own plans, and execute those plans according to their own standards. Other units aren't part of militaries at all; for example, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mistryl_Shadow_Guard\" title=\"The Mistryl Shadow Guard\">The Mistryl Shadow Guard</a> is an organization unto itself, and though beholden to the Eleven Elders of the People it answers to no higher military authority other than its own leaders. </p>\n <p>Heroes can choose to use these organizations as a part of their characters' histories or simply as models for creating their own, similar organizations. Having the heroes all choose a single unit as their organization makes it very easy for both the players and the Gamemaster to justify why heroes of such disparate skills and personalities might be working together. Serving as members of the same Military Unit is a great way for heroes to find common ground without having to resort to elaborate descriptions of how each hero knows each other hero and why they would all be working together. Moreover, having the heroes all be members of the same Military Unit makes it much easier to design adventures for those heroes, as they all have common (If not identical) goals and motivations. </p>\n <p>By the same token, these Military Units can be used as allies and antagonists for heroes in any campaign, not just those with a military theme. Each Military Unit in this chapter contains information on its goals, methods, rank structure, and missions to give the Gamemaster a solid idea of how the organization functions and what its members could be like. When creating NPC allies and antagonists, using these Military Units is a great way to give an adventure a warfare-based twist without having to alter the structure of the entire adventure. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bases_and_Battlestations\">Bases and Battlestations</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article:<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_Bases_and_Battlestations\" title=\"GaW Bases and Battlestations\"> Bases and Battlestations</a></i> </p>\n <p>No military campaign is complete without missions to infiltrate, sabotage, or destroy the opposing force's base of operations. Whether this means breaking into an Imperial prison colony to rescue a Rebel agent or piloting a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Starfighter\">Starfighter</a> into the heart of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Death_Star\" title=\"The Death Star\">The Death Star</a>, military campaigns are full of adventures that involve heavily defended locales. This chapter covers everything the Gamemaster needs to create exciting adventuring sites- hereafter referred to generically as \"Battlestations\"- from basic concepts all the way through encounter design. </p>\n <p>A Battlestation is more than just a Death Star or some other massive superweapon. In this chapter, the term \"Battlestation\" means a fortified and actively defended location where adventures will take place. A Battlestation can come in many forms, whether it is a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Station\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Space Station\">Space Station</a>, a ground installation, or a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ship\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Capital Ship\">Capital Ship</a>. </p>\n <p>Of course, before the villains can wreak havoc with a Battlestation of the heroes can commandeer it for their own noble purposes, the place has to be built. This chapter not only covers the basic rules for assigning statistical values to the various aspects of a Battlestation, but also introduces factors that affect a station in the game. Moreover, it includes specific environment rules for creating encounters on Battlestations. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Military_Encounters\">Military Encounters</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_Military_Encounters\" title=\"GaW Military Encounters\">Military Encounters</a></i> </p>\n <p>This chapter is intended for Gamemasters and contains several mini-adventures ideally suited for military-style encounters. If you're a player, you probably should skip over this chapter and wait for your GM to spring these adventures on you and the other players in your group. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Operation:_First_Breach\">Operation: First Breach</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_Operation:_First_Breach\" title=\"GaW Operation: First Breach\">Operation: First Breach</a></i> </p>\n <p>\"Operation: First Breach\" is a short campaign heavily focusing on planetary warfare. This campaign is set during the Clone Wars, but with some slight adaptation it can be altered to fit almost any era that features two powerful military forces at war with one another. In this campaign, the heroes take on the role of a strike force sent to soften the defenses of a world controlled by their enemies, a theme that fits in with almost any era. </p>\n <p>This short campaign is designed to run with 3nd and 4th level characters. Although some of the challenges in this campaign may be a bit tougher than 3rd-level heroes normally have to face, resourceful characters should be able to handle themselves. </p>\n <p>If you are a player, you should stop reading now so that you do not spoil any surprises for yourself. If you are the Gamemaster, be sure to read through this campaign thoroughly before running it. </p>    \n</div>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":{},"providedItems":{},"payload":"","cost":"","weight":"","availability":"","size":"","type":"","subtype":"equipment","categories":[],"items":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"equipment":{}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"pGtT90haS6MKKbBW"}

As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Swift Action\">Swift Action</a>, you can switch the Weapon from Blaster mode to Ascension mode.

Some seek refuge from a hostile government, a vengeful syndicate, or their own troubled past. However, no matter what drives beings to the wildest and least understood areas of the galaxy, they must rely on their own abilities and skills to survive. </p>\n <p>When exploring The Unknown Regions, adaptable and diversely trained heroes perform best. Those trained in survival techniques or adjustable styles of combat do well when physically exploring new worlds.

Although the best explorers can get by with the bare necessities of a breather and a blaster, only the reckless and the foolhardy venture out into the unknown expanses of the galaxy without the Equipment necessary to ensure both success and survival. Any veteran scout can tell you that when you're a million light-years away from civilization, your wits and your gear make the difference between accomplishing your mission and death. Explorers prize durability and functionality over aesthetics, because their lives require equipment that works over equipment that looks good. Despite what the holos show, an explorer's life isn't glamorous. </p>\n <p>Anyone can recognize the need for a reliable weapon when venturing into unknown and potentially hostile territory, but those who take up the scouting life often need far more, because there are as many potential hazards waiting for the unwary as there are stars in the galaxy. An explorer soon learns how to determine the right tool for the environment he or she is heading into. An <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aquata_Breather\" title=\"Aquata Breather\">Aquata Breather</a> is of little use on a world that has no moisture and a toxic atmosphere. And while a bulky <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Suit\" title=\"Space Suit\">Space Suit</a> is a lifesaver in the cold darkness of space, it can be a liability on a world that has thick vegetation. Those whose explorations consist mainly of scouting enemy encampments know that being detected by the people you are spying on frequently leads to a bad end. Every explorer comes to rely on a core set of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment\" title=\"Equipment\">Equipment</a>, including <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons\" title=\"Weapons\">Weapons</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor\" title=\"Armor\">Armor</a>, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles</a>. </p>\n <p>Although a good explorer can find a use for almost any piece of Equipment, some pieces have become mainstays in the explorer's arsenal, varying little even when the political landscape changes drastically. Some Equipment can prove just as useful in civilized space as it can on some unknown chunk of dirt. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Exploration_Campaigns\">Exploration Campaigns</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Exploration_Campaigns\" title=\"UR Exploration Campaigns\">Exploration Campaigns</a></i> </p>\n <p>Every <i>Star Wars</i> film begins with the same words, which remind us that a galaxy full of adventure waits for us. Untold worlds exist beyond the many already known by name. Exotic creatures wait after the next hyperspace jump to aid or confound fife heroes. Every roleplaying session with your friends is an opportunity to explore new worlds together and create classic adventure stories. The galaxy is a big place. Every world is an adventure waiting to happen. </p>\n <p>One of the great appeals of <i>Star Wars</i> is the exotic locations where stories can take place. Every planet seems familiar, yet has a unique element that makes it memorable.

Explorers continually push beyond the frontier and expand the fringe. Some operate as part of a governmental body, looking for worlds to colonize and conquer. Some operate as employees of galaxy-spanning companies that seek new worlds to exploit for profit. And others operate on their own in small, battered ships, trying to carve out a home in the spiraling void. </p>\n <p>This chapter includes suggestions on how to make worlds that will resonate in your stories. It has resources and advice for building new worlds, as well as a planet generator to help when time or inspiration is lacking. It also suggests different ways to bring the theme of exploration to the forefront of your <i>Star Wars</i> campaign. And, because attitudes about exploration differ throughout the eras, summaries of those attitudes are included here. This chapter introduces two campaign outlines that have exploration as their central theme. Each of these campaigns offers suggestions on how to customize the campaign to best fit your play style. Also check out the tips and guidelines on how to include exploration as a theme in an ongoing campaign. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Creating_New_Worlds\">Creating New Worlds</span></h3> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Creating_New_Worlds\" title=\"Creating New Worlds\">Creating New Worlds</a></i> </p>\n <p>Encountering new worlds is central to Unknown Regions adventures.

Every planet has its own perils- whether menacing plant life, an unsafe atmosphere, or something worse- and any explorer can confirm that the greatest danger when traveling to a new world is encountering some new Hazard not yet known to the galaxy at large. Stormtroopers and Sith Lords are obvious threats to the safety of just about everyone, but it is often the unseen and unexpected Hazards that bring heroes down. </p>\n <p>Hazards, first introduced in the <i>Saga Edition Core Rulebook</i>, appear throughout <i>Star Wars</i> films, novels, comics, and other sources. Until now, Hazards have been basic rules elements used to address a variety of situations that might come up during a game. This chapter's goal is to make Hazards more appealing as a regular part of adventure and encounter design. When the heroes visit strange worlds in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions</a>, they should feel as if every step could lead them into dangerous territory. By using Hazards more frequently, you can emphasize the fact that the heroes are far from home in a place where many of the galaxy's niceties simply are not present.&nbsp; </p>\n <p>This chapter introduces a new format for Hazards, along with rules for designing your own Hazards and suggestions for using them in your adventures. Additionally, the chapter provides many sample Hazards that are ready to be used in a game; these examples also will help guide you in creating your own Hazards. The samples are grouped by environment, so you can choose Hazards appropriate to the setting and level of your adventure and drop them in as needed. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Designing_New_Hazards\">Designing New Hazards</span></h3> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Designing_New_Hazards\" title=\"UR Designing New Hazards\">Designing New Hazards</a></i> </p>\n <p>Designing Hazards is much like designing new terrain or other challenges that can spice up an encounter or an adventure. Unlike the process for designing an enemy character, Beast, Droid, or Vehicle, the process for designing a new Hazard is somewhat simpler, and it helps you cater directly to the needs of your particular adventure by creating elements that add diversity to encounters. You can follow a series of basic steps to design a Hazard that challenges your players and makes sense in the context of the adventure. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sample_Hazards\">Sample Hazards</span></h3> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Sample_Hazards\" title=\"UR Sample Hazards\">Sample Hazards</a></i> </p>\n <p>The remainder of this chapter presents sample Hazards that should give you enough examples and guidelines to help you design your own Hazards. The section below starts with Hazards from <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hazards\" title=\"Hazards\">Hazards</a> article, which have been reformatted using the rules in this chapter, then it explores new Hazards based on environment. Some of the Hazards from the <i>Core Rulebook</i> do not exactly conform to the suggested Hazard attack and damage numbers, but have been reproduced in the new format for ease of use. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Threats\">Threats</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Threats\" title=\"UR Threats\">Threats</a></i> </p>\n <p>Hidden from the rest of the, galaxy, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions</a> hold many <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species</a> capable of interstellar travel. Their initial contact with civilizations of known space is often difficult and violent. Even after a group emerges from the darkness of the unknown and meets others, it takes years to establish a mutual understanding of cultures, protocols, and spheres of influence. Formal relations usually develop slowly, although ad-hoc, emergency, or informal agreements can serve both sides in the short term. </p>\n <p>This chapter describes some of the most prominent threats of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions</a> and the era in which they were revealed to the galaxy. However, explorers from known. space might encounter them decades or millennia earlier. Gamemasters should feel free to adapt the threats to meet the needs of games set in previous eras. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Planets\">Planets</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Planets\" title=\"UR Planets\">Planets</a></i> </p>\n <p>Planets of every type and description exist throughout the galaxy, and the worlds of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions</a> are inherently mysterious to explorers and adventurers. These planets are untamed, and all hold their own secrets. Some provide environmental challenges, pitting heroes against natural hazards and hostile creatures. Others are home to previously unknown civilizations that have their own internal struggles and conflicts. </p>\n <p>This chapter includes eight new worlds created specifically for use in a <i>Saga Edition</i> campaign. For the heroes, these planets are truly fresh locales, and the only way to learn about these worlds is to explore them- players will not find them in any movies, novels, or comics. Although the planets are new, each embodies the distinctive feel of <i>Star Wars</i>. These planets are meant to serve as new places the heroes can explore during their first trips into <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions</a>. </p> \n <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Deep_Space_Encounters\">Deep Space Encounters</span></h2> \n <p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Deep_Space_Encounters\" title=\"UR Deep Space Encounters\">Deep Space Encounters</a></i> </p>\n <p>This chapter is intended for Gamemasters and contains several mini-adventures best used with heroes in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions</a>. If you are a player, you probably should skip this chapter and wait for your Gamemaster to spring these adventures on you and the other players in your group. </p>\n <p>Occasionally, heroes take a tangent that their Gamemaster had not planned for, or the Gamemaster needs to fill a few hours of play with an entertaining diversion from the main plot. The Gamemaster can improvise something, but, when he or she is at a loss for a scenario (Or is just pressed for time), a mini-adventure might fit the bill. </p>\n <p>The Deep Space Encounters presented here take place on or around the planets covered in Chapter 6: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Planets\" title=\"UR Planets\">Planets</a>. Exploration of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions</a> is an integral part of the mini-adventures. The encounters available in this chapter cover a wide range of Challenge Levels and plots, including exploring an abandoned space station, rescuing a stranded pilot, freeing a victim from the clutches of a cult, and tracking down an ancient and dangerous Sith Artifact. Each adventure includes an outline of the events and challenges in the adventure, which the Gamemaster can use to construct a few \"Off-the-Cuff\" situations- or as a jumping-off point for future encounters. </p>\n <p>In addition, each mini-adventure also features a fully developed tactical encounter designed to serve as the climax of the scenario. The Gamemaster can use these encounters as written, alter the details to play to the heroes' strengths, or completely redesign them to fit the needs of the campaign. The Gamemaster can also reference these encounters when designing his or her own mini-adventures and scenarios. </p>\n <p>Although these Deep Space Encounters are designed to be completely independent of one another, common threads run through all of them, allowing them to be strung together and run as a minor campaign within the main campaign. How they are used is purely up to the Gamemaster's discretion. </p>\n <p><br> </p>    \n</div>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":{},"providedItems":{},"payload":"","cost":"","weight":"","availability":"","size":"","type":"","subtype":"equipment","categories":[],"items":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"equipment":{}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"tCmt7Henv0BSm2pc"}

The longer blade setting allows the wielder to keep an opponent at a distance during a duel, but Dual-Phase Lightsabers on this setting are also more unwieldy, making it difficult to defend against opponents that get up close to the wielder. </p>\n <p>In its Default Form, a Dual-Phase Lightsaber functions as a normal <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_(Weapon)\" title=\"Lightsaber (Weapon)\">Lightsaber</a>.
