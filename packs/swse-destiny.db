{"name":"Starship-Linked","type":"destiny","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"<p>Sometimes, a Starship is more than just a means of transportation. Sometimes, it's part of a character's <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a>. In fact, for some characters, it's the focal point of their <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a>, which might otherwise be nothing more than to wander aimlessly from one jam to another. No matter how humble (Or downright ramshackle) a Starship might appear, if it's the <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a> of a character to be linked with that ship, it can accomplish amazing things. </p><p>If you decide to link a Starship (Or, rarely, a Planetary Vehicle) to your <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a>, that replaces the normal <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a> mechanic. In essence, you don't have a <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a> to accomplish any specific goal; instead, you're destined to have the most important events in your life with a specific Starship. This option is appropriate in campaigns with at least a moderate frequency of <a href=\"/wiki/Starship_Scale\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Starship Scale\">Starship Scale</a> encounters, but it's certainly not restricted to such campaigns. In fact, if a campaign centers exclusively around <a href=\"/wiki/Starship_Scale\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Starship Scale\">Starship Scale</a> action, this option might be too powerful as it allows you to access your <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny_Points\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destiny Points\">Destiny Points</a> in most encounters. Only the GM can decide if Starship-Linked Destinies are appropriate for a given campaign. </p><p>You earn and spend <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny_Points\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destiny Points\">Destiny Points</a> with a Starship-Linked Destiny using the same basic rules as with the normal destiny options. You gain one <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny_Point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destiny Point\">Destiny Point</a> at each level, and they never return once you spend them. However, having your <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a> linked to a Starship causes the rules to work slightly differently. </p><p>First, if Starship-Linked is your <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a>, it is never completely destroyed. Even if it is blown up in battle or confiscated by Hutts before being crushed and melted, some small part of it survives. Perhaps you find the hyperspace core the whole Starship was built around, or its ruined hull is found drifting as debris after that battle. Your Starship can cease to be functional as easily as anyone else's, but a recognizable part of it always survives for you to rebuild (Or retrofit to a similar Starship). It can be as time consuming and difficult as getting a new Starship would be (If not more so), but the result still qualifies as your Starship-Linked Destiny. </p><p>Secondly, the options you can exercise by using a <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny_Point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destiny Point\">Destiny Point</a> are slightly different, as detailed below. The following are possible only when you are acting as a crew member (<a href=\"/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)\" title=\"Pilot (Vehicle Combat)\">Pilot</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Copilot\" title=\"Copilot\">Copilot</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Gunner\" title=\"Gunner\">Gunner</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/System_Operator\" title=\"System Operator\">System Operator</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Commander\" title=\"Commander\">Commander</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Engineer\" title=\"Engineer\">Engineer</a>) on the Starship linked to your Destiny: </p><p>In general, a character with a Starship-Linked Destiny can do what no one else can manage- unless they, too, are linked to its <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a>. There's nothing to prevent multiple characters from being Destiny-Linked to the same Starship. Such characters might share the ship, or might constantly be stealing, buying, or gambling it back and forth between them. </p><p>Unless a Starship or Vehicle is linked to a character's <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a>, a character cannot use a <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny_Point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destiny Point\">Destiny Point</a> or any other ability (Such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Jedi_Master\" title=\"Jedi Master\">Jedi Master</a> class feature <a href=\"/wiki/Serenity\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Serenity\">Serenity</a>) that automatically causes a specific outcome for an attack roll or skill check. <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a> is intensely personal, relying on the individual's deepest connection to <a href=\"/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force</a>- something incompatible with these massive, lifeless machines.

Then you need to determine the extent to which your character's <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a> overlaps with theirs. </p><p>The easiest way to connect your character to a Legacy is to adopt a known family name. The <i>Star Wars</i> saga is full of them, and you have access to virtually any name used in almost any era. If you've played campaigns set in earlier <i>Star Wars</i> eras, consider reusing the family name of one of your past characters, and build on that Legacy. </p><p>Establishing connections to the past gives your character hooks around which the Gamemaster can hang adventures. For example, if your character descends from a legendary noble family, he or she can take advantage of longstanding family alliances. Conversely, your character might also need to contend with ancient blood feuds and rivalries. </p><p>By their very nature, Legacies require a strong family association. The following guidelines will help you establish your character's Legacy: </p><p>Gamemasters are encouraged to integrate Legacies into the campaign by including allies and enemies tied to each character's Legacy, and by allowing characters the opportunity to interact with members of organizations that have historical ties to their families. </p><p>One big advantage of playing in <a href=\"/wiki/The_Legacy_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Legacy Era\">The Legacy Era</a> is that players can play heroes belonging to famous families. However, some Gamemasters (and players, too) might get hung up on the fact that certain characters in the <i>Legacy</i> comics already \"Carry the Torch\" for particular families (such as Cade Skywalker and Roan Fel). Stickers for continuity might be reluctant to allow characters access to these Legacies for fear of bringing their campaigns into conflict with official canon stories. Gamemasters are urged to let players choose Legacies they wish, headless of canon. As Cade Skywalker blasts his way across the galaxy, there's no reason why a player cannot also play a member of the <a href=\"/wiki/Skywalker_Legacy\" title=\"Skywalker Legacy\">Skywalker Legacy</a>, provided the player can work with the Gamemaster to devise a compatible background for his or her character. </p><p>One important thing for Gamemasters and players to remember is that being a descendant of a famous character from <i>Star Wars</i> history does not always mean being a <i>direct</i> descendant. A character with the <a href=\"/wiki/Solo_Legacy\" title=\"Solo Legacy\">Solo Legacy</a> might be descended from a distant branch of the Solo family tree, with closer ties to Thrackan Sal-Solo than Han Solo, for instance. Since <a href=\"/wiki/The_Legacy_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Legacy Era\">The Legacy Era</a> is far forward in <i>Star Wars</i> continuity, a hero might be several branches removed from his or her famous ancestors. As long as the player can come up with an interesting reason for his or her character to have a particular Legacy, the Gamemaster should consider allowing it to pass without worrying too much about fitting it into established continuity. In the end, the player will feel like he or she is truly playing a hero of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe. </p><p>The rules for creating characters with Legacies are tied to the <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a> system. Since the <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a> system is considered optional, the Gamemaster must choose whether to include the rules for Legacies or not. If you choose not to allow these rules in your campaign, you can still encourage your players to design characters from famous lineages, taking advantage of the story opportunities for Legacy characters without using the game mechanics. </p><p>When a player wishes to play a character with a Legacy, he or she may choose The Legacy Destiny (See below). The Legacy Destiny has its own benefits and drawbacks, as do all <a href=\"/wiki/Destinies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destinies\">Destinies</a>, but characters with The Legacy Destiny also gain access to a special use for <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny_Points\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destiny Points\">Destiny Points</a>. When a player selects The Legacy Destiny for his or her character, he or she must choose a Legacy from the list of sample Legacises presented below (See Established Legacies) or work with the Gamemaster to create a new Legacy with it's own mechanical benefits and drawbacks (See Creating Your Own Legacies, below). Gamemasters have final say as to whether or not a given character can choose a particular Legacy based on the needs of the campaign. </p><p>Many Legacy effects allow you to spend a <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny_Point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destiny Point\">Destiny Point</a> to get a 20 on a <a href=\"/wiki/Skill_Check\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Skill Check\">Skill Check</a> without having to roll; this is not considered a \"Natural 20\" for the purposes of any other effect, such as regaining <a href=\"/wiki/Force_Powers\" title=\"Force Powers\">Force Powers</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Starship_Maneuvers\" title=\"Starship Maneuvers\">Starship Maneuvers</a>. </p><p>This section introduces a new kind of <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a>: The Legacy Destiny. The same rules that apply to <a href=\"/wiki/Destinies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destinies\">Destinies</a> also apply to The Legacy Destiny. In addition, there are some special bonuses and penalties that apply as well, depending on whether your character chooses to Embrace or Deny their Legacy. </p><p>Unlike other <a href=\"/wiki/Destinies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destinies\">Destinies</a>, a Legacy Destiny does not grant permanent benefits once the <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny\" title=\"Destiny\">Destiny</a> is fulfilled. Instead, a character with The Legacy Destiny gains a special benefit whenever he or she spends a <a href=\"/wiki/Destiny_Point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destiny Point\">Destiny Point</a>: the exact benefit depends on the character's Legacy (see Established Legacies, below). </p><p>A hero fated to uphold a family Legacy might refuse to acknowledge it and, by their actions, undermine it. Conversely, a character who has sworn to deny his family's Legacy might be driven to perform acts in keeping with the greatest deeds of his or her ancestors. From a character development and plot standpoint, the resulting tension and conflict can be very dramatic. However, the Legacy mechanic is structured in a way that penalizes and deters players from taking such actions. </p><p>If a player wishes to fight against a Legacy mainly for character development or plot purposes, and the Gamemaster does not wish to constantly penalize the character for good roleplaying, the GM may apply the bonuses and penalties only at dramatic or climactic points in an adventure, ignoring them during smaller encounters. </p><p>If you Embrace Your Legacy, you must take actions that further your family's cause, beliefs, or organization. This might be through promoting a belief system, keeping an organization intact and viable, or even directly carrying out stated tasks or orders. An example of this Legacy would be to uphold the ideals of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Jedi_Order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Order\">The Jedi Order</a> as previous generations of your family have done. </p><p>If you Deny Your Legacy, you must select actions that fly in the face of an ancestor's cause, belief, or organization. You only gain bonuses when actively working against your Legacy or making a conscious effort to walk away from an action that would advance your Legacy. An example of this Legacy would be Cade Skywalker's early efforts to shun the path of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi</a>. </p><p>Circumstances might conspire to change a hero's outlook regarding their family Legacy. Such a dramatic shift in attitude could be a climactic moment in a campaign or adventure, sending the hero off in a completely different direction, possibly turning enemies into allies and vice versa. Once switched, a hero is unlikely to return to his or her original path, and should be discouraged from doing so. A character who switches from Embracing their Legacy to Denying their Legacy, or vice versa, suffers the following effects for the next 24 hours: </p><p>This list includes recurring names that appear throughout the <i>Star Wars</i> saga. A player might decide to choose a name with less widespread recognition- such as Jinn or Mothma. In some cultures, clan affiliations are more important and have survived for centuries. </p><p>The Established Legacies presented above are far from exhaustive, and Gamemasters might wish to create their own Legacies to fit the needs of heroes in their campaigns. Creating a new Legacy is not a precise exercise, but the following steps should make it easy for Gamemasters to create new Legacies with balanced mechanics. </p>","attributes":{"0":{"override":false,"value":" When a character completes a goal or performs an act worthy of their family's Legacy, they gain a +2 Destiny bonus to a single attack roll or skill check of their choice made in the next 24 hours.","key":"destinyBonus"},"1":{"override":false,"value":" When a character does something unworthy of their family's Legacy, they take a -2 penalty on their first attack roll in any given encounter for the next 24 hours.","key":"destinyPenalty"}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"zkMp6nVsZRHoiNYJ"}
