Droids can increase any two of their five remaining <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Abilities\" title=\"Abilities\">Ability Scores</a> by +1 each at 4th level and every four levels thereafter, just like any other character. These increases represent improved heuristics and algorithms that the Droid has developed from experience as well as upgrades to its components undertaken as part of routine maintenance. Droid <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Abilities\" title=\"Abilities\">Ability Modifiers</a> are determined by their Degree and size. A Droid can never have an <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Abilities\" title=\"Abilities\">Ability Score</a> less than 1, regardless of modifications. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Automatic_Languages\">Automatic Languages</span></h3> \n <p>All Droids can speak, read, and process <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Binary\" title=\"Binary\">Binary</a>, as well as understand one language chosen by the designer (Usually Basic). </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Behavioral_Inhibitors\">Behavioral Inhibitors</span></h3> \n <p>Droids (Except 4th-Degree Droids) cannot intentionally harm a sentient living being or knowingly allow a sentient living being to be harmed. Furthermore, all Droids must follow orders given to them by their rightful owners, as long as those orders don't require the Droid to harm a sentient living being. Droids with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heuristic_Processor\" title=\"Heuristic Processor\">Heuristic Processors</a> can sometimes violate these restrictions by creatively interpreting their behavioral inhibitors. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ion_Damage_Vulnerability\">Ion Damage Vulnerability</span></h3> \n <p>As electronic constructs, Droids are vulnerable to damage from <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ion_Weapons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ion Weapons\">Ion Weapons</a>.

Droids do not have a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Abilities\" title=\"Abilities\">Constitution</a> score, so they don't get bonus Hit Points for having a high <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Abilities\" title=\"Abilities\">Constitution</a>, and they apply their <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Abilities\" title=\"Abilities\">Strength</a> modifier to their <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fortitude Defense\">Fortitude Defense</a>. Unlike living beings, Droids don't \"Die,\" but they can be disabled or destroyed. </p>\n <p>If a Droid is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it is disabled and cannot be reactivated until it is repaired so that it has at least 1 hit point. If the attack that reduced the Droid to 0 Hit Points also exceeds the Droid's <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Damage Threshold\">Damage Threshold</a>, the Droid is destroyed instead.

Shutting down a willing Droid is a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Standard Action\">Standard Action</a>. Shutting down an unwilling Droid is more difficult, requiring you to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grab\">Grab</a> the Droid, and then make a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics\" title=\"Mechanics\">Mechanics</a> check (DC = Droid's <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Will Defense\">Will Defense</a>) as a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Standard Action\">Standard Action</a> while its grabbed.

Although they are essentially living machines, Droids cannot be treated as simply another <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species</a> or character type. Below are common Droid issues and information on adjudicating them. </p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Damaged_and_Destroyed_Droids\">Damaged and Destroyed Droids</span></h3> \n <p>Damaged and destroyed Droids are treated similarly to organic heroes when it comes to damage and death. However, Droids are also machines and can be reassembled or have their data accessed by other means, so they have additional options not available to organic characters. New approaches to damage and destruction are presented below. Information on Droid damage and repair from the <i>Saga Edition Core Rulebook</i> is also included here for convenience. </p> \n <ul>\n  <li><b>Conditions:</b> A Droid is treated the same as an organic character when it comes to the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Condition Track\">Condition Track</a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Conditions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Persistent Conditions\">Persistent Conditions</a>. Unlike organic characters, however, a Damaged Droid might gain a quirk (See <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid_Quirks\" title=\"Droid Quirks\">Droid Quirks</a>).</li> \n  <li><b>Destroyed:</b> If a Droid is reduced to 0 Hit Points by an attack that deals damage equal to or greater than its <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Damage Threshold\">Damage Threshold</a>, the Droid is Destroyed. However, it can spend a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Force Point\">Force Point</a> to become Disabled instead of Destroyed.</li> \n  <li><b>Disabled:</b> When a Droid is Disabled (The equivalent of being unconscious), it moves -5 steps on the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Condition Track\">Condition Track</a>, falls <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prone\">Prone</a>, and is unable to take any <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Actions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Actions\">Actions</a>. It remains inert and inoperative until repaired. A Droid that is repaired immediately reactivates and can get up to fight again, but it starts <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prone\">Prone</a>.</li> \n  <li><b>Repair Droid (Requires <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tool_Kit\" title=\"Tool Kit\">Tool Kit</a>):</b> A character with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics\" title=\"Mechanics\">Mechanics</a> as a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trained Skill\">Trained Skill</a> can spend 1 hour of work and make a DC 20 <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics\" title=\"Mechanics\">Mechanics</a> check to repair a Damaged or Disabled droid, restoring Hit Points equal to the Droid's Character Level and removing any <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Conditions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Persistent Conditions\">Persistent Conditions</a> currently affecting the Droid. A Droid can attempt to repair itself, but it takes a -5 penalty on its skill check.</li>\n </ul> \n <h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"New_Optional_Rules\"><b>New Optional Rules</b></span></h4> \n <p>The following new optional rules can be included, in whole or in part, in your game to give Droid Heroes some of the versatility seen in the <i>Star Wars</i> films. As with all optional rules, inclusion of the following rules in the game is subject to Gamemaster approval. </p> \n <ul>\n  <li><b>Sacrificial Appendage:</b> When a Droid would normally be reduced to 0 Hit Points or moved to the bottom of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Condition Track\">Condition Track</a>, the Droid can choose instead to have one of its limbs severed. If the droid chooses this option, it is instead moved to the -4 step on the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Condition Track\">Condition Track</a>, or, in the case of being reduced to 0 Hit Points, it retains 1 Hit Point. The sacrificed <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Appendage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Appendage\">Appendage</a> should be a limb rather than a tool that the droid can easily do without. The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Appendage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Appendage\">Appendage</a> can be successfully reattached with a repair check (See <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Repair_Droid\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Repair Droid\">Repair Droid</a>). The Droid receives Hit Points from the repair, as usual.</li> \n  <li><b>Destroyed Droids:</b> Taking into account the method of destruction, the Gamemaster determines what parts of a Droid remain after it is destroyed. Blaster fire or an explosion might scatter small and large pieces around the area. A Droid destroyed by a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lightsaber\">Lightsaber</a> might have slices or holes burned through its chassis, or large sections of the Droid's appendages might be completely severed. The Gamemaster should also determine which of the Droid's systems, accessories, appendages, or tools are damaged or destroyed.</li> \n  <li><b>Reactivating a Destroyed Droid:</b> At the Gamemaster's discretion, a character can attempt to salvage and reactivate a destroyed Droid. Reactivating a Droid requires that its <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Processor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Processor\">Processor</a>, power source, and communication interface must be intact. The battery and communication interface can be replaced or replicated if needed. A destroyed Droid cannot reactivate itself. The character attempting the reactivation must make a DC 20 <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics\" title=\"Mechanics\">Mechanics</a> check and work on the droid for 5 minutes. \n   <ul>\n    <li>A character can attempt to reactivate a Droid as a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Full-Round Action\">Full-Round Action</a>, increasing the DC to 30. If the check is successful, the Droid moves + 1 step on the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Condition Track\">Condition Track</a>. However, the Droid is still considered to have 0 Hit Points and cannot move, attack, or take any action other than skill checks for skills based on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence\" title=\"Intelligence\">Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom\" title=\"Wisdom\">Wisdom</a>, or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma\" title=\"Charisma\">Charisma</a>.</li>\n   </ul></li> \n  <li><b>Salvaging a Destroyed Droid:</b> Salvaging a destroyed Droid requires a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tool_Kit\" title=\"Tool Kit\">Tool Kit</a>, time, spare parts, and additional <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics\" title=\"Mechanics\">Mechanics</a> checks (See <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Repair_Droid\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Repair Droid\">Repair Droid</a>). A reactivated Droid can assist in its own repairs by using the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Aid Another\">Aid Another</a> Action, although it cannot attempt to repair itself directly. The time required to salvage a Droid can be affected by the level of destruction sustained by the Droid. Repairs might take several hours, several days, or even several weeks, as determined by the Gamemaster. Destroyed Droids usually require spare parts costing 50% or more of the Droid's original cost.</li>\n </ul> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Improvised_Droid_Tasks\">Improvised Droid Tasks</span></h3> \n <p>Heroes might try to take maximum advantage of the unique resources a droid offers. A Droid's built-in equipment, traits, and unique social status in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe cause Droids and Droid Heroes to be called upon to carry out tasks well beyond their original programming. </p>\n <p>When considering an unusual request for or by a Droid character, consider the following: </p> \n <ul>\n  <li><b>Does the droid have a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heuristic_Processor\" title=\"Heuristic Processor\">Heuristic Processor</a>?</b> If not, then the request must be governed by the standards of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Basic_Processor\" title=\"Basic Processor\">Basic Processor</a> or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Remote_Processor\" title=\"Remote Processor\">Remote Processor</a>, so the task must be laid out in specific terms.

Even if the tasks are clearly delineated, the Droid might perform them poorly or inefficiently or become confused if the task does not proceed as planned. \n   <ul>\n    <li>A Droid equipped with a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heuristic_Processor\" title=\"Heuristic Processor\">Heuristic Processor</a> is better equipped to handle unusual situations, so it can act on fewer, less specific instructions. Additionally, focusing on the advantages of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heuristic_Processor\" title=\"Heuristic Processor\">Heuristic Processor</a> emphasizes the choice of processor in Droid creation, rewarding those players who select it.</li>\n   </ul></li> \n  <li><b>Is the request already covered by an existing <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Talent\">Talent</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feat\">Feat</a>, or Droid special quality?</b> Don't shortchange players who select certain Heroic Class, Droid, or Droid Prestige Class <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents\" title=\"Talents\">Talents</a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats\" title=\"Feats\">Feats</a> by allowing other Droids to replicate those abilities too often. If it seems reasonable that a given Droid might be capable of an action similar to an existing ability, allow the action to proceed with a lesser chance of success and/or a lesser result than could be gained with the existing ability.</li> \n  <li><b>Is the request likely to be abused by the player in future sessions, or likely to become exploited regularly?</b> If not, allow the idea to be used at least in this instance. However, if the idea could become an unwelcome addition to future sessions, the Gamemaster can avoid denying its use outright by allowing the character to spend a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Force Point\">Force Point</a> or a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny_Point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destiny Point\">Destiny Point</a> (If appropriate) for the action. Another option is for the Droid to suffer a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Persistent Condition\">Persistent Condition</a> and move -1 or more steps on the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Condition Track\">Condition Track</a> at the end of the task.</li> \n  <li><b>Should the task be covered by new <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Talent\">Talent</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feat\">Feat</a>, or special quality? </b>Some tasks generated by players are more appropriately covered by creating a new Droid-degree <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Talent\">Talent</a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feat\">Feat</a>, or special quality. If the player creates a wholly customized or new Droid Model, a special quality can be added at the Gamemaster's discretion. \n   <ul>\n    <li>If the Droid is an existing stock model, create a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Talent\">Talent</a> or a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feat\">Feat</a> instead. If the ability seems like something a Droid ought to be able to learn, create a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feat\">Feat</a>. If the ability seems focused on a trademark task of a particular model or degree of Droid, create a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Talent\">Talent</a> specific to that degree of Droid.</li>\n   </ul></li> \n  <li><b>Adjudicating simple and complex tasks.</b> If the Gamemaster decides to proceed with the request, he or she should decide what actions, attacks, and skill checks are required for success. Simple tasks are typically covered by one skill check, but unique circumstances might require more time and/or multiple checks. Complex tasks should take multiple rounds with multiple checks.</li> \n  <li><b>Plan for failure.</b> A Droid that performs a task outside its realm of expertise can make for potentially amusing or unexpected situations if it fails. The Droid might become confused, carry out the next operation without completing the first task, return unexpectedly, call on the owner for clarified instructions, or give up and report the failure. In the middle of a battle or a critical mission, this failure can cause confusion or threaten a mission's success, forcing the heroes to act quickly to resolve the situation. Gamemasters should take advantage of this potentially dramatic or amusing situation.</li>\n </ul> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Droid_that_Gained_levels\">The Droid that Gained levels</span></h3> \n <p>In adventuring parties featuring less than five players, adding a Gamemaster-controlled Droid to the party can be a great way to balance the party without having to adjust your encounter design. Many gaming groups can only muster three or four players and a Gamemaster, while the game is designed for a typical group of five players and a GM. Filling those empty player spots with Droids is a nice option, because a Droid can easily fade into the background during noncombat encounters, whereas a living character that does so might seem shallow and one-dimensional. If you decide to include a Droid ally as a means of filling out the party's numbers, you should probably think about the Droid just like you would any other major Gamemaster character, and plan on it being with the party for the duration of the campaign. </p>\n <p>You should choose a Droid Model that fills an appropriate niche in the party. Similarly, you should probably think about the kinds of adventures your heroes are going to be going on, and what roles need to be filled. If the party lacks a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)\" title=\"Pilot (Vehicle Combat)\">Pilot</a>, a Pilot Droid seems like a good choice. However, there are other considerations. Some Droids don't do well on adventures due to their forms (Try getting that <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wheeled\" title=\"Wheeled\">Wheeled</a> Droid up a long set of stairs). A good option for creating Droids to round out a party of heroes is to use a stock <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid_Chassis\" title=\"Droid Chassis\">Droid Chassis</a> and then build the Droid from the ground up. This not only lets you build exactly the kind of Droid you need to fill a gap in the party, it unshackles you from the usual physical forms of various Droids. </p>\n <p>As the heroes gain levels, so should the Droid. The levels you choose for your Droid should likewise continue to help the Droid fill in the gaps in the party. If the party is short on firepower, the Droid should take levels with a high <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Base Attack Bonus\">Base Attack Bonus</a> and good combat <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents\" title=\"Talents\">Talents</a>. However, you also have another option to consider. If you want the Droid to grow and to develop as an interesting Gamemaster character, consider having the Droid take levels in the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Independent_Droid\" title=\"Independent Droid\">Independent Droid</a> Prestige Class. This helps represent the fact that the Droid is becoming more and more unique thanks to its time with a party of heroes at the center of great, galaxy-shaking events. </p> <!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20210123221914\nCache expiry: 1209600\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.021 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.022 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 157/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\n--> <!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n--> <!-- Saved in parser cache with key prod:swse:pcache:idhash:3749-0!canonical and timestamp 20210123221917 and revision id 53665\n --> \n</div>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":[],"providedItems":[],"payload":"","categories":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"prerequisite":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"CBMwVweE6Y8kZSJX"}

The moon has a highly unusual cycle of light and dark, sometimes illuminated brightly and other times shrouded in complete darkness. To compensate for these uncertain conditions, Gotals evolved special cones atop their heads that sense subtle shifts in the electromagnetic field, allowing them to operate in light or dark without hindrance. The cones are sensitive enough to sense not only the presence of living creatures nearby but also a creature's mood or intent. </p>\n <p>Emotions are an important part of Gotal culture. Young Gotals live in a constant state of confusion as they are bombarded by the emotions of others. Learning to handle this input is what pushes a Gotal toward adulthood and maturity. Adult Gotals are calm, almost serene beings, but despite their outward appearance, they feel the full breadth of emotions. Because they are so sensitive to emotions, Gotals quickly form meaningful relationships with one another. Gotals prefer to be around their own kind and dislike <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids\" title=\"Droids\">Droids</a>, mainly because the electromagnetic fields produced by <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids\" title=\"Droids\">Droids</a> cause an irritating buzz perceptible to the Gotals' heightened senses. </p>\n <p>Gotals learned long ago to keep their opinions to themselves, and thus they make excellent negotiators and diplomats. Some individuals, however, use their natural abilities for nefarious purposes and become assassins or bounty hunters, tracking their prey by the emotional trail it broadcasts. Most <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species</a> appreciate the self-discipline that Gotals exhibit, but some are hesitant to associate with members of the Species for fear of having their private passions and motivations revealed. </p>\n <p><br> </p> <!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20210427011015\nCache expiry: 1209600\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.014 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 8/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 3726/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 3/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\n--> <!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    9.114      1 -total\n100.00%    9.114      1 Template:SpeciesTemplateCategory\n 76.11%    6.937      1 Gotals\n--> <!-- Saved in parser cache with key prod:swse:pcache:idhash:17873-0!canonical and timestamp 20210427011015 and revision id 59510\n --> \n</div>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":[],"providedItems":[{"name":"Species Templates","type":"trait"}],"payload":"","categories":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"prerequisite":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"CtJ9MOQGBzILHK9F"}

Even then, the Chiss remain an enigmatic, secretive Species. Their origins are largely unknown, even to the Chiss themselves, though some scientists believe they are descended from an isolated <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human</a> colony lost to time. </p>\n <p>The Chiss are technologically advanced, keenly interested in art and science, and skilled at mathematics. Though logical in their mindset, they are also appreciative of philosophy, and interested in other cultures. Given their xenophobic tendencies, it comes as no surprise that the Chiss use their understanding of non-Chiss cultures to gain a tactical advantage over potential adversaries. </p>\n <p>Chiss society is highly ordered and structured. Rule of law is controlled and enforced by a small number of ruling \"Families.\" These ruling families, also known as clans or houses, are more akin to different branches of government than to actual familial units. As a rule, a Chiss will never knowingly do anything to bring shame upon his or her family, for entire lines have been exiled for the actions of a single family member. </p>\n <p>The culture of the Chiss is based on a strict code of conduct. As a rule, they do not attack an opponent unless they are attacked first. Thrawn ignores this imperative when he seizes control of the Imperial remnants, and consequently he is exiled from his people. Although most Chiss are peaceful, once embroiled in military conflict, they do not relent until their opponents are either totally destroyed, or completely subjugated. </p>\n <p><br> </p> <!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20210428233529\nCache expiry: 1209600\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.008 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 8/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 3715/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 3/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\n--> <!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    4.006      1 -total\n100.00%    4.006      1 Template:SpeciesTemplateCategory\n 54.34%    2.177      1 Chiss\n--> <!-- Saved in parser cache with key prod:swse:pcache:idhash:17826-0!canonical and timestamp 20210428233529 and revision id 59371\n --> \n</div>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":[],"providedItems":[{"name":"Species Templates","type":"trait"}],"payload":"","categories":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"prerequisite":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"EeMkuAoRcM8Uhjla"}

Although they have been part of galactic civilization for millennia, very few Umbarans have left their home system, and even fewer have risen to positions of power and fame in the galaxy. Umbarans are interested in alien cultures and civilizations, but they prefer to observe from a distance rather than take an active role in events. </p>\n <p>During the rise of the Empire, the Umbarans spend a few decades moving through the halls of supreme political power. An Umbaran named Sly Moore serves as Palpatine's chief aide during his later years as Chancellor of the Republic and the earliest period of his reign as Emperor. Moore's prominence in galactic politics causes her to be so admired on her homeworld that she inspires other Umbarans to venture out into the rest of the galaxy. Many of them join Moore on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant</a>, and soon Umbarans are a common sight on that world. </p>\n <p>As Palpatine's New Order becomes increasingly biased toward <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans</a>, Moore vanishes from the Emperor's side and moves into more shadowy roles within his government. From deep within the intelligence apparatus, she and other Umbarans lead efforts to root out anyone who is not unquestionably loyal to Emperor Palpatine, and they answer only to the Emperor. They are so effective that even Emperor Palpatine's most dedicated followers grow to fear them, something that strengthens the antialien sentiment among many of the Emperor's closest advisers. The Umbarans are particularly disliked by officers of Imperial Intelligence, who resent the fact that they are subject to Umbaran scrutiny- a resentment that grows every time the Umbarans unmask a Rebel double agent in their ranks. </p>\n <p>After the death of Emperor Palpatine and the collapse of his government, the Umbarans find themselves under threat from the Rebels they had hunted and the New Order supporters they had intimidated. When former head of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard forges a powerful coalition on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant</a> dedicated to reestablishing a strong Galactic Empire, the remaining Umbarans flee the planet, knowing that Isard will seek brutal revenge for the embarrassments they caused her organization when she was rising through the ranks of Imperial Intelligence. </p>\n <p>Even before the fall of the Empire, however, Umbarans already begin to retreat from the galaxy. As the full scope of Emperor Palpatine's evil becomes more evident and knowledge of the atrocities committed in his name more widespread, the Umbarans grow embarrassed over Moore's association with the Emperor, and they resume their reclusive ways. In fact, they withdraw even more fully than before, fearing retribution from the many <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species</a> surrounding them. </p>\n <p>As memories of the Empire start to fade in the minds of the galaxy's beings, Umbarans begin to filter back out into the galaxy in the low numbers typical of their off-world presence during the Old Republic. </p>\n <p><br> </p> <!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20210425145040\nCache expiry: 1209600\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.009 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.019 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 8/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 6100/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 3/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\n--> <!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   14.577      1 -total\n100.00%   14.577      1 Template:SpeciesTemplateCategory\n 79.19%   11.543      1 Umbarans\n--> <!-- Saved in parser cache with key prod:swse:pcache:idhash:17880-0!canonical and timestamp 20210425145040 and revision id 59524\n --> \n</div>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":[],"providedItems":[{"name":"Species Templates","type":"trait"}],"payload":"","categories":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"prerequisite":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"PTwr6MGjeXr2wBK5"}

Rather than bringing the full might of the Imperial Navy to bear on the Ssi-Ruuk invaders, the Emperor negotiated to a secret treaty with them. Using prisoners and slaves as some of the raw materials for Battle Droids appealed to the Emperor; in exchange for data on the Ssi-Ruuk entechment process, Palpatine secretly ceded a number of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Outer Rim\">Outer Rim</a> systems to the Ssi-Ruuk to do with as they pleased. </p>\n <p>One of these star systems was <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bakura\" title=\"Bakura\">Bakura</a>, a small colony that had been settled by a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human</a> religious fringe group centuries before.

This represented the first time the factions in the Galactic Civil War would have to declare a temporary truce to deal with an outside threat. </p>\n <p>After successfully defeating the Ssi-Ruuvi armada at Bakura, the Alliance mounted an offensive against the Ssi-Ruuk Empire. This led to on-again, off-again diplomatic talks with the Ssi-Ruuk, who lacked the resources to wage war on two fronts. Diplomatic talks with the Ssi-Ruuk continue well into <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era\" title=\"The New Jedi Order Era\">The New Jedi Order Era</a>, but they have not completely eliminated border skirmishes.

Black-scaled Ssi-Ruuk are usually trained as assassins, while brown-scaled Ssi-Ruuk have no caste whatsoever and are treated as outcasts. </p>\n <p>Like many reptilian beings, the Ssi-Ruuk have poor vision but an excellent sense of smell.

Older Draethos eventually overcome this barrier. </p>\n <p>Partly due to their long lives, Draethos society is slow to evolve and relies heavily on tradition. Attitudes developed before the Knights of the Old Republic<i> </i>era remain central to Draethos society thousands of years later. The stability of the Draethos culture caused exiles to have trouble understanding the complex changes in alien societies. </p>\n <p><br> </p> <!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20210504175405\nCache expiry: 1209600\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.009 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 8/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 2704/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 3/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\n--> <!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    4.785      1 -total\n100.00%    4.785      1 Template:SpeciesTemplateCategory\n 57.30%    2.742      1 Draethos\n--> <!-- Saved in parser cache with key prod:swse:pcache:idhash:17428-0!canonical and timestamp 20210504175405 and revision id 58749\n --> \n</div>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":[],"providedItems":[{"name":"Species Templates","type":"trait"}],"payload":"","categories":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"prerequisite":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"VHtSNr3ijhmWyoIN"}

The unusual structure of their brain led Imperial xenobiologists to conclude that they were a distinctly alien Species. </p>\n <p>The highly evolved Sakiyan brain is nearly twice the size of the average <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human</a> brain. While the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bith\" title=\"Bith\">Bith</a> brain remains one of the most advanced among common alien <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species</a>, the parts of the Sakiyan brain that process sensory input are superior even to the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bith\" title=\"Bith\">Bith</a>. These keen senses helped primitive Sakiyans survive against the fierce predators of their homeworld, but even as the Species developed the intellect to use tools and construct weapons and shelters, they retained their sharp senses. In fact, Sakiyans possess what other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species</a> consider nigh-supernatural perception. </p>\n <p>A series of offworld invasions punctuate Sakiyan history, during which the culture survived by maintaining a constant state of vigilance.

Further, every household and government agency relies on lightweight repulsorlift platforms to quickly transport people, resources, and supplies to safe havens. </p>\n <p>Once mobile, Sakiyan troops then conduct a constant series of hit-and-run attacks against enemies until their invaders withdraw from the conquered lands.

Sakiyans quickly adopted and improved repulsorlift technology introduced to them by Old Republic scouts. Over the centuries, they have adapted the technology to their needs, focusing primarily on making the motivators smaller and more efficient. The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hutts\">Hutts</a> are particularly fond of Sakiyan repulsorlift technology, as it allows them to construct smaller and more elegant repulsor sleds. </p>\n <p>Thanks to its location near the heart of Hutt Space, the Sakiyan homeworld escaped the tyranny of the Empire, although many Sakiyan technicians were forced to relocate to Imperial research installations, where they contributed to the development of a new generation of Imperial repulsortanks.

Despite the misgivings of other high-ranking members of the Techno Union, Skakoan foreman Wat Tambor pledged to support the Separatists under Count Dooku. The Senate responded by expelling their Techno Union representatives.

Experts from the University of Sanbra speculate that the climate change was likely very sudden (At least, sudden in geological terms) given the fact that the Pau'an Species did not evolve or adapt to the high winds as many other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species</a> did. The long gap between Pau'an generations caused by their extremely long lives was probably responsible for this evolutionary stumbling block, and were it not for the migration of Pau'an civilization underground they might not have survived the climate change. </p>\n <p>The shift to life underground did not change the Species' eating habits, as they maintained many of the biological signs of a carnivorous diet. The ecology of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Utapau\" title=\"Utapau\">Utapau</a>, particularly with regard to an abundance of animal life in sinkholes and below ground, allowed the Pau'ans to retain their carnivorous ways, which persist into modern times. </p>\n <p><br> </p> <!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20210504175238\nCache expiry: 1209600\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.007 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.013 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 8/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 4697/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 3/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\n--> <!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    9.549      1 -total\n100.00%    9.549      1 Template:SpeciesTemplateCategory\n 82.16%    7.845      1 Pau'ans\n--> <!-- Saved in parser cache with key prod:swse:pcache:idhash:17910-0!canonical and timestamp 20210504175238 and revision id 59613\n --> \n</div>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":[],"providedItems":[{"name":"Species Templates","type":"trait"}],"payload":"","categories":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"prerequisite":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"hmI9rdzpiPxfEi5s"}

{"name":"Sorcerers of Rhand","type":"trait","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"finalName":"","description":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"> \n <p><br> The Sorcerers of Rhand live deep in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions</a>, hidden by the red flow of the Perann Nebula from any disciples of The Dark who wish to tap their knowledge. Their reclusiveness is a blessing, for if the Sorcerers of Rhand were to unleash the full entropic power of what they call The Dark, the entire galaxy might come to ruin. </p>\n <p>The Sorcerers or Rhand are realists. They understand that the power of destruction, coupled with time, has more ability to change the universe than any effort of creation. They devote their efforts to understanding its purpose and ultimately divining a way to become agents of The Dark. By manipulating the forces of destruction, they can bring their enemies to ruin. </p>\n <p>The Sorcerers do not care about the traditions of the Jedi and the Sith. The idea of a \"Force\" with a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Side\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Light Side\">Light Side</a> and a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dark Side\">Dark Side</a> strikes them as quaint and naïve. When they tap into The Dark, they are not communicating with an energy field created by living things (By definition, a fleeting, transitory trifle) but with the fundamental law of reality. </p>\n <p>According to Succate's annals, the Sorcerers are the culmination of three ancient philosophical schools. The first is the Knell of Muspilli, a death cult from the moon trees of the Gunninga Gap that transcribed the Taurannix Codex to call forth apocalyptic deities from beyond the Gap's spatial fissure. </p>\n <p>The second school is the Kanzer Exiles, a fanatical flock of reptilians led by the Lord Ravager Korman Lao. These exiles expanded their faith through mental enslavement and built a world-sized temple near the Valtaullu Rift. </p>\n <p>The third school is an offshoot of the Warriors of the Shadow-Taung soldiers beaten by the Battalions of Zhell in the prehistory of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant</a>. After surviving the war and a volcanic plume of ash that filled the skies for two years, the priestly sisterhood of the Taungs fled to the Unknown Regions to seek atonement through meditation and insight. </p>\n <p>Thousands of years bring about the merging of these belief systems on the worlds of the Nihil Retreat near the Perann Nebula. Deep within the nebula itself, on the planet <a class=\"new\" title=\"Rhand (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvUmhhbmQ/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Rhand</a> that gives the new movement its name, the greatest Sorcerers take up residence in the dark ruins of a long-dead species. Outposts and monasteries on the twelve planets of the Nihil Retreat come to be populated by acolytes of the faith (Known as Rhandites), who have not yet attained true insight into The Dark. </p>\n <p><br> </p> <!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20210503062434\nCache expiry: 1209600\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.017 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 8/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 5094/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 3/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\n--> <!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   12.303      1 -total\n100.00%   12.303      1 Template:SpeciesTemplateCategory\n 81.00%    9.965      1 Sorcerers_of_Rhand\n--> <!-- Saved in parser cache with key prod:swse:pcache:idhash:17898-0!canonical and timestamp 20210503062434 and revision id 59558\n --> \n</div>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":[],"providedItems":[{"name":"Species Templates","type":"trait"}],"payload":"","categories":[],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":[],"isSupplied":false,"prerequisite":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"1dNtqJ6yKjRXLa7y":3},"flags":{},"_id":"zzgIS8ROd8UCp5WE"}
