Currently, the compendiums for this system are generated from the wiki.  To decrease process time this is done as world compendiums that automatically update when changes are pushed.  this only works when logged in as the game master or someone with access to modify compendiums.  if you need to refresh the compendiums for any reason log in as game master, open the console and type:
```javascript
game.swse.generateCompendiums(true)
```
