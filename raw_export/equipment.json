Rebel agents find them useful because the basic components are usually at hand. However, their unpredictability causes agents to use them only when desperate. The bomb works by taping 2 to 5 <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Packs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Power Packs\">Power Packs<\/a> together, then disabling the packs' sturm dowels, thereby causing the packs to build up an excessive charge and to explode after about 30 seconds. <\/p><p>Although blaster <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Packs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Power Packs\">Power Packs<\/a> are typically used, any large power cell can be adapted to the task.

If you fail by 5 or more on your <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer\" title=\"Use Computer\">Use Computer<\/a> check to improve access, the Credit Chip's security program detects the intrusion attempt and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Self-Destruct_System\" title=\"Self-Destruct System\">Self-Destructs<\/a>. <\/p><p>Modifying a Credit Chip so that government and bank computers think that it draws on a different account or that it has a different value stored is almost impossible: The central bank's computers have a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Will Defense\">Will Defense<\/a> of 30, and a starting <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Attitude\">Attitude<\/a> of Hostile; even worse, you won't know if your check succeeded until after you attempt to use the modified Credit Chip. If you fail, the government or bank computer orders the chip's <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Self-Destruct_System\" title=\"Self-Destruct System\">Self-Destruct<\/a> programming to activate, ruining the chip. If you fail by 5 or more, the chip's <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Self-Destruct_System\" title=\"Self-Destruct System\">Self-Destruct<\/a> programming activates, and the government or bank computer traces your location, dispatching security personnel to apprehend you. <\/p>"

Generally, the license is not expensive, and obtaining it has few if any additional legal requirements.<\/li> \n <li><b>Restricted: <\/b>Only specifically qualified individuals or organizations are technically allowed to own the object. However, the real obstacles to ownership are time and money; anyone with sufficient patience and cash can eventually acquire the necessary license.<\/li> \n <li><b>Military: <\/b>The object is sold primarily to legitimate police and military organizations. A military rating is essentially the same as restricted, except that manufacturers and dealers are generally under tight government scrutiny and are therefore especially wary of selling to private individuals.<\/li> \n <li><b>Illegal: <\/b>The object is illegal in all but specific, highly regulated circumstances.<\/li>\n<\/ul><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Getting_A_License\">Getting A License<\/span><\/h2><p>To get a license, you must pay the fee required to file the application.

Death Sticks come in a variety of forms, including a liquid form that can be consumed in a drink, and produce a temporary euphoric effect. Unfortunately, the side effects are devastating, as each use ravages the user's immune system and measurably shortens the user's lifespan. Death Sticks are also highly addictive, as the length of the euphoric reaction shrinks with each use, requiring the more heavily addicted users to consume several times the normal amount just to get a sustained reaction from the Death Sticks. Death Sticks are <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Illegal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Illegal\">Illegal<\/a> on many worlds for precisely this reason, as some populations (including the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Balosars\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Balosars\">Balosars<\/a>) has been seriously impacted by Death Stick use among youths. Recovering from Death Stick addiction is difficult and usually requires medical assistance. <\/p><p>However, Death Sticks also have a second purpose, at least for Cade Skywalker and others like him. As a former Jedi Padawan, Cade's connection to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a> is strong, and, as a result, he is more able to sense the drug's effects on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Sensitivity\" title=\"Force Sensitivity\">Force Sensitivity<\/a>. As Cade discovers after obtaining Death Sticks from the pirate Rav, Death Stick use dulls one's connection to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a>, at least for a short while. Cade uses Death Sticks to prevent the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Spirits\" title=\"Force Spirits\">Force Spirits<\/a> of his ancestors from visiting him as frequently. A Force-user that partakes in Death Sticks can shut themselves off from the emotions of those around them and eliminate visions of the future, past, and present, which (for those who have experienced great tragedies, like Cade Skywalker) can be preferable despite the physical toll of Death Stick use. <\/p><h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Using_Death_Sticks\"><b>Using Death Sticks<\/b><\/span><\/h4><p>Consuming a Death Stick grants the user a +1 morale bonus on all attack rolls and a +1 morale bonus to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses\" title=\"Defenses\">Defenses<\/a> for the duration of the Death Stick's euphoria.

Death Stick euphoria initially lasts for 1 hour, but each subsequent use reduces the length of the euphoria by 5 minutes. At the end of the euphoria's duration, the Death Stick makes an attack roll at a +10 bonus (increased by +1 for each subsequent Death Stick use) against the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fortitude Defense\">Fortitude Defense<\/a> of the user; if the attack hits, the target becomes addicted to Death Sticks. <\/p><p>A character addicted to Death Sticks moves -1 <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Persistent\">Persistent<\/a> step down the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Condition Track\">Condition Track<\/a> each day they do not use Death Sticks, and the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Persistent Condition\">Persistent Condition<\/a> can only be removed by the use of a Death Stick.

Secrets are whispered in dark corners, bribes pass through corrupt hands, and saboteurs and assassins directly attack the resources and allies of their enemies. A campaign full of intrigue is a campaign full of mystery, where as one layer of the plot is revealed, so are three more mysteries whose true meaning have yet to be discovered. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Introduction\">Introduction<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Introduction\" title=\"GoI Introduction\">Introduction<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>The civilizations of the <i>Star Wars<\/i> galaxy are bound together in an intricate web of intrigue. Except for the most reclusive, every sentient being in the galaxy is involved in a conspiracy or plot, whether he or she knows it or not. A plot might be as benign as a corporation's ad campaign or as insidious as a scheme to overthrow the Republic. Heroes are pushed and pulled by powerful forces, such as planetary governments, the Jedi Council, or the military. A hero might owe a favor or have an obligation to someone and in turn wield control over others. Because of this web of intrigue, an <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intrigue_Campaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intrigue Campaign\">Intrigue Campaign<\/a> can quickly move from the immediate to the vast, depending on how involved and wide-ranging the Gamemaster wants to make the adventure. <\/p><p><i>Galaxy of Intrigue<\/i> is designed for any era of the <i>Star Wars<\/i> timeline. Whether during the Old Republic, Clone Wars, Rebellion, or Legacy eras, life in the galaxy is complicated, as planets wage war with each other, ideologies clash, and rulers fight for domination and to achieve the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destinies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destinies\">Destinies<\/a> that lie within their reach. Even the relative peace preceding the Clone Wars is riddled with intrigue as groups and individuals take advantage of a distracted and apathetic populace to forward their own agendas. <\/p><p>With <i>Galaxy of Intrigue<\/i>, Gamemasters can plunge heroes into a campaign of conspiracy. Although the heroes might be caught up in the plots of others, they can take an active role in solving mysteries or using their influence to help shape the galaxy, pulling the strings of intrigue themselves. <i>Galaxy of Intrigue<\/i> presents rules and suggestions for including noncombat elements into a campaign, allowing players with a flair for personal interaction, dialogue, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Skill\">Skill<\/a> use to stand out. Characters from the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble\" title=\"Noble\">Noble<\/a> Heroic Class, with the most <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills<\/a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents\" title=\"Talents\">Talents<\/a> for solving problems with dialogue or quick thinking, benefit most from the ideas presented in <i>Galaxy of Intrigue<\/i>. However, <i>Galaxy of Intrigue<\/i> offers plenty for every <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Heroic Class\">Heroic Class<\/a>, even the most martial <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soldiers\">Soldiers<\/a>.

The galaxy is an enormous place with a huge variety of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, ideologies, corporations, and other groups jockeying to gain power and to carve their own destinies. A dense, if delicate, web of negotiations, treaties, alliances, and obligations weaves disparate groups together to stop the civilizations of the galaxy from descending into chaos. Sometimes this web keeps the peace, but often stability is threatened or overturned as masterminds scheme for more control. For the heroes, adventure is around every corner and, more often than not, comes looking for them instead of the other way around. <\/p><p>An <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intrigue_Campaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intrigue Campaign\">Intrigue Campaign<\/a> has plenty of room for every type of character, although creating heroes for an <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intrigue_Campaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intrigue Campaign\">Intrigue Campaign<\/a> requires a bit more thought than it might in other settings. Campaigns that focus on intrigue are less about kicking down doors and tossing thermal detonators (although these is a time and place for that, as well) than about the gradual, but steady, discovery of information and secrets as the heroes unravel plots. This chapter provides more <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats\" title=\"Feats\">Feats<\/a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents\" title=\"Talents\">Talents<\/a>, and a new twist on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills<\/a> to help your characters fit into a world of backroom deals, clandestine meetings, blackmail, infiltration, and political maneuvering. <\/p><p>At first glance, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble\" title=\"Noble\">Noble<\/a> Heroic Class seems to be the wisest choice in an <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intrigue_Campaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intrigue Campaign\">Intrigue Campaign<\/a>.

The heroes must rely on their powers of observation and deduction to move the story along, as well. <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Intrigue_Heroes\">Intrigue Heroes<\/span><\/h3><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intrigue_Heroes\" title=\"Intrigue Heroes\">Intrigue Heroes<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>The galaxy is rife with intrigue. Every <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, corporation, planet, fiefdom, and other group has its own agendas and methods for getting its way. With so many interests jockeying for power, for good or for ill, nearly every individual can be considered to be involved in some form of conspiracy, if only as part of a demographic to be catered to or exploited. Even the hinterlands of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim\" title=\"The Outer Rim\">The Outer Rim<\/a> are home to plots for riches or power, meaning that only the most isolated creatures can truly pursue their destinies without influence. Heroes, however, are not such beings. They find themselves more enmeshed in the games of intrigue with every passing moment. This section explores how heroes who embrace those schemes and maneuvers can rise to become more than mere pawns- they can be vital parts of the board and, in some cases, the players who move the pieces in the first place. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Skill_Challenges\">Skill Challenges<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Skill_Challenges\" title=\"GoI Skill Challenges\">Skill Challenges<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>The <i>Star Wars<\/i> saga is full of examples of heroes doing amazing things. Such remarkable exploits often take place during shootouts, Lightsaber duels, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dogfights\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dogfights\">Dogfights<\/a> between X-Wings and TIE Fighters. But not every exciting scene in the films is about combat; many of them focus more on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills<\/a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents\" title=\"Talents\">Talents<\/a> that do not relate directly to fighting prowess. Chase sequences, stealthy investigations, tense negotiations, and other such scenes reflect the heroes' abilities to use their cunning, their creativity and their well-honed skills to achieve their goals. <\/p><p>This chapter introduces the concept of Skill Challenges to the <i>Star Wars <\/i>roleplaying game. A Skill Challenge is a mechanical framework that Gamemasters can use to create exciting and interesting scenes in which the heroes use their <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills<\/a>, not their combat abilities, to accomplish a particular goal. In a Skill Challenge, the heroes make a series of related <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks\" title=\"Skill Checks\">Skill Checks<\/a> that combine to determine whether they face victory or defeat. A Skill Challenge can take the place of a combat encounter in an adventure or can augment a combat encounter by adding a skill-based element. <\/p><p>Many scenes from the <i>Star Wars<\/i> films could be represented in a roleplaying game as Skill Challenges. The asteroid chase in <i>The Empire Strikes Back<\/i>, the negotiation between Luke Skywalker and Jabba the Hutt in <i>Return of the Jedi<\/i>, the Podrace in <i>The Phantom Menace<\/i>, Obi-Wan's investigation of the Jango Fett mystery in <i>Attack of the Clones<\/i>- all these are examples of sequences in which heroes use multiple <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills<\/a> to accomplish a task. Typically, a Skill Challenge represents a scene or a group of scenes that moves the plot forward through skill use rather than combat. <\/p><p>This chapter teaches Gamemasters how to create their own Skill Challenges and run them in adventures. Players might want to familiarize themselves with the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Playing_Skill_Challenges\" title=\"Playing Skill Challenges\">Playing Skill Challenges<\/a> section, which provides tips on interacting with Skill Challenges and using them to create exciting, cinematic scenes. <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Playing_Skill_Challenges\">Playing Skill Challenges<\/span><\/h3><p>For players, Skill Challenges represent a chance not only to use your <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills<\/a> in a meaningful way, but also to have your heroes contribute to an exciting scene. Skill Challenges are great for fleshing out your characters, letting their personalities come to life in the actions they take outside of combat encounters. A Skill Challenge offers an opportunity to roleplay your characters' strengths, and perhaps even weaknesses, in a dynamic way. <\/p><p>As a player, your responsibility in the Skill Challenge is to come up with creative actions that can help your allies achieve the goal of the challenge. When it is your turn, think of an action that is appropriate for your hero in that situation. If possible, the action should play to your hero's strengths and give you a chance to show off your character's areas of expertise. Describe the action to your Gamemaster, and, if the GM approves of the idea, make a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Skill Check\">Skill Check<\/a> (or another check that the GM calls for) to determine the result. Once each of your allies has had a chance to act, it will be your turn again, provided that the Skill Challenge has not ended. <\/p><p>Over the course of the Skill Challenge, the situation might evolve. You might receive new information, the backdrop could change, or the goals could shift as the challenge progresses. Be sure to think about how your hero would react to the changing circumstances of the Skill Challenge, and come up with new and interesting things to do. Below are some tips to help you choose actions that will contribute to an exciting, dynamic scene. <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Running_Skill_Challenges\">Running Skill Challenges<\/span><\/h3><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Running_Skill_Challenges\" title=\"Running Skill Challenges\">Running Skill Challenges<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>In many ways, a Skill Challenge is like any other encounter. It has opportunities for success and penalties for failure. It requires multiple heroes to participate and often has both obstacles and antagonists. However, whereas combat encounters require the heroes to use weapons or special attacks to achieve victory, a Skill Challenge requires them to use their <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills\" title=\"Skills\">Skills<\/a> and creativity to succeed. <\/p><p>One of the most important points to remember is that a Skill Challenge, like a combat encounter, is meant to create and exciting scene or sequence of scenes in the tradition of the <i>Star Wars<\/i> films. A Skill Challenge should have the same tension and uncertainty as a combat encounter, with real consequences for success and failure. When running a Skill Challenge for players, you have many of the same responsibilities as when running a combat encounter: you must keep the game moving, ensure that the pace does not slow too much, encourage players to be creative and act cinematically, and adjudicate the rules of the challenge. <\/p><p>The basic Skill Challenge mechanics are relatively simple. Over the course of the challenge, the heroes take actions that either succeed or fail. If the heroes accrue a set number of successes before a set number of failures, they succeed in the challenge. If they accrue too many failures, they fail the challenge. <\/p><p>Of course, that description is a very simplified version of the mechanics; the rest of this section provides a step-by-step breakdown of the process used when the Gamemaster runs a Skill Challenge. Throughout this breakdown, examples walk you through a sample Skill Challenge based on the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a> Speeder Bike chase in <i>Return of the Jedi<\/i>. The examples do not detail the entire sequence, but instead they highlight how elements of the Skill Challenge combine to create and exciting and iconic scene from <i>Star Wars<\/i> lore. The premise of the Skill Challenge is that the heroes have arrived on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a> and encountered a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout_Trooper\" title=\"Scout Trooper\">Scout Trooper<\/a> Patrol. Their goal is to make sure the scouts do not report back to their superiors and alert the Empire to the Rebel presence on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a>. <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Designing_Skill_Challenges\">Designing Skill Challenges<\/span><\/h3><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Designing_Skill_Challenges\" title=\"Designing Skill Challenges\">Designing Skill Challenges<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>Designing a Skill Challenge is much like designing a combat encounter. As the Gamemaster, you determine the location of the Skill Challenge, the obstacles and antagonists that might play into the scene, several options for providing the heroes with variety, and the consequences of success or failure. Conceptually, Skill Challenges and combat encounters are similar, although they differ in execution. <\/p><p>This section walks you through the creation of a Skill Challenge, from the initial concept to challenge effects that can be added to spice things up. By following these steps, you can create Skill Challenges that contribute to exciting scenes in the <i>Star Wars<\/i> tradition. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Equipment\">Equipment<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Equipment\" title=\"GoI Equipment\">Equipment<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>For most of the intrigue-savvy people of the galaxy, wits and secrecy are the two most valuable weapons in their arsenals. However, sometimes inherent ability and learned skills are only part of what it takes to maintain secrecy or manipulate one's enemies. From time to time, even the wisest conspirators must make use of the technology that the galaxy has to offer, although they often use those things in deceptive ways. For the master of intrigue, equipment and weapons are merely a means to an end, but one should always make sure to have the right tools for the job. <\/p><p>Most equipment used by masters of intrigue is designed to either create or enhance deception, keep secrets a secret, reveal someone else's secrets, or protect the keeper of a secret from harm. For example, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Xerrol_Nightstinger\" title=\"Xerrol Nightstinger\">Xerrol Nightstinger<\/a>, which produces an invisible blaster bolt, creates deception by preventing observers from seeing where the shot comes from. Likewise, the same weapon can be used to keep a secret a secret by taking out someone who is doing too much snooping around. Most of the equipment and weapons in this chapter perform one of those four functions, but they do so in very different ways. <\/p><p><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids\" title=\"Droids\">Droids<\/a> are always something of a risk in an intrigue-based campaign. On one hand, Droids are immune to many tricks that living beings are susceptible to. They often cannot be bribed, smooth talked, or deceived into revealing the information within their databanks. They are often more focused on their missions than are living beings, and and they are incapable of actively betraying someone thanks to their rigid programming. However, Droids also present a significant risk, in that someone with the right computer slicing skills can extract information from them. Moreover, Droids are often less capable of defending themselves and thinking creatively than their living counterparts, making it more likely that they will fall into enemy hands. <\/p><p>Most of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles<\/a> presented in this chapter are designed to put more tools in the hands of the intrigue-minded player or villain. Scout ships with excellent sensor cloaks can make spying on the enemy easier, and many spies prefer vessels with low profiles over those that, while more defensible, are more likely to attract notice. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Intrigue_Campaigns\">Intrigue Campaigns<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Intrigue_Campaigns\" title=\"GoI Intrigue Campaigns\">Intrigue Campaigns<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>In addition to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a>, the galaxy is bound together by one other factor- intrigue.

Even a simple avenue in an obscure settlement on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine\" title=\"Tatooine\">Tatooine<\/a> can hold a wealth of secret deals, power struggles, and tangled relationships- all potential hooks for adventure. <\/p><p>An Intrigue Campaign can occur during any <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Era_of_Play\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Era of Play\">Era of Play<\/a>, so Gamemasters have full leeway in when and where the game can take place. During <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Old Republic Era\">The Old Republic Era<\/a>, corporate power expands and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith<\/a> operate openly. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rise_of_the_Empire_Era\" title=\"The Rise of the Empire Era\">The Rise of the Empire Era<\/a> is thick with intrigue, espionage, and intelligence gathering, not only between the Republic and the Separatists, but also among neutral or otherwise unaligned planets and organizations- each with its own motives and agendas. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Times\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Dark Times\">The Dark Times<\/a> are rife with paranoia and treachery, with the heroes facing the unbelievable might of the Empire. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Rebellion Era\">The Rebellion Era<\/a> pits <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance<\/a> against Imperial forces for years, leaving tremendous room for any intrigues the Gamemaster and players develop. <\/p><p>In an Intrigue Campaign, the heroes delve into the tangled skein of intrigue to foil plots and expose the truth. As with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fringe_Campaigns\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fringe Campaigns\">Fringe Campaigns<\/a>, the heroes do not have to be the most law-abiding or altruistic individuals, and in fact, characters who strictly adhere to legal behavior can derail a campaign to a certain degree, since breaking and entering, assassination, extortion, and illegal slicing are standard themes. In most cases, the heroes are the underdogs, going up against powerful political organizations, corporations, or criminal networks. Secrecy and duplicity are the tools of an Intrigue Campaign, and even trust can be employed as a weapon. Nothing is as it seems in this type of campaign, as layers are peeled away to reveal deeper, darker secrets threatening the safety of the galaxy and the balance of good and evil. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Factions_and_Organizations\">Factions and Organizations<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Factions_and_Organizations\" title=\"GoI Factions and Organizations\">Factions and Organizations<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>In the <i>Star Wars<\/i> galaxy, war is not always obvious and in the open. While the skies are full of fighters and blaster reports echo in the streets, more subtle combatants watch from the shadows. A Rebel deep within the ranks of the Imperial Army can do as much for the war effort as a fighter pilot on the front line. In fact, they might do more than the pilot, because if they do not \"Lose\" a report from their <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Intelligence\" title=\"Imperial Intelligence\">Imperial Intelligence<\/a> counterpart inserted inserted into the staff of Admiral Ackbar, the pilot could be blown to pieces by a much larger, much better prepared force guarding the convoy they are sent to raid. <\/p><p>As the Empire and the Alliance struggle for control of the galaxy, leaders of noble houses curry favor with one side or the other, all the while hedging their bets. No matter which side wins, the nobles plan to retain their wealth and power. <\/p><p>The same is true in the boardrooms of the galactic megacorporations. Backroom talks are organized with those who have the Emperor's ear, while security operatives are dispatched to either befriend or defend against the Alliance. The companies exist to supply the galaxy with goods and to turn a profit, and they need to protect their ability to do this during both war and peace. <\/p><p>Small stellar nations on the Empire's borders, such as those of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chiss_Ascendancy\" title=\"The Chiss Ascendancy\">The Chiss Ascendancy<\/a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hapes_Consortium\" title=\"The Hapes Consortium\">The Hapes Consortium<\/a>, need to secure their safety during and after the conflict. And while Imperial troops and Alliance soldiers blast away at each other, double agents, corporate spies, and emissaries from noble houses and independent governments whisper to one another and exchange information in their out-of-the-way corners. War in the shadows can be every bit as exciting as the one being waged in the open. <\/p><p>This chapter presents organizations that embody some of the intrigues that can unfold in a <i>Star Wars<\/i> campaign. The members of those organizations can be the heroes' friends, foes, or both, depending on the objectives to be achieved. Although most parts of the Empire and the Alliance are as clearly contrasted as black and white, many of the groups in this chapter defy such easy categorization. <\/p><p>They say to keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When it comes to the organizations and people in this chapter, the heroes might not be able to tell the difference. <\/p><h2><span id=\"Nyriaan.2C_World_of_Intrigue\"><\/span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nyriaan,_World_of_Intrigue\">Nyriaan, World of Intrigue<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Nyriaan,_World_of_Intrigue\" title=\"GoI Nyriaan, World of Intrigue\">Nyriaan, World of Intrigue<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>The planet Nyriaan is the center of a struggle as turbulent as the planet's violent atmosphere. It is a world rich in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Madilon\" title=\"Madilon\">Madilon<\/a>, a rare naturally occuring alloy that is crucial to modern <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive\" title=\"Hyperdrive\">Hyperdrive<\/a> production, making Nyriaan an invaluable piece on the game boards of a dozen competing galactic superpowers. Nyriaan possesses great stories of a much-sought-after commodity, and many beings in the galaxy would do almost anything to acquire those resources. Controlled by none and coveted by many, Nyriaan is a dangerous planet steeped in intrigue and conspiracy. <\/p><p>Nyriaan is covered in a dense cloud layer that makes landing on the planet without assistance challenging. Moreover, the planet's atmosphere makes sending data and other communication by any means difficult, effectively walling off the planet from the rest of the galaxy. The high demand for Nyriaan's resources, combined with the difficulty that outsiders face when attempting to intervene in the planet's affairs, creates a situation where only those on the planet can truly influence the flow of resources to the galaxy, and it puts a great deal of power in the hands of those who control the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Madilon\" title=\"Madilon\">Madilon<\/a> mines on the planet's surface. <\/p><p>By the same token, the inhabitants of Nyriaan are caught in the midst of a constant struggle between the various factions seeking to control the planet's natural resources. Daily life on Nyriaan is filled with political maneuvering, infighting between factions, espionage, sabotage, and the scheming machinations of the most cunning minds in the galaxy. Although tensions on Nyriaan rarely erupt into full-scale, violent conflict, the intrigue runs so thick on the planet that anyone- and everyone- is entangled in some scheme or plot. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Intrigue_Encounters\">Intrigue Encounters<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_Intrigue_Encounters\" title=\"GoI Intrigue Encounters\">Intrigue Encounters<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>This chapter is intended for Gamemasters and contains several mini-adventures ideally suited for heroes of intrigue. If you are a player, you probably should skip this chapter and wait for your Gamemaster to spring these adventures on you and the other players in your group. <\/p><p>Occasionally, heroes take a tangent that their Gamemaster had not planned for, or the Gamemaster needs to fill a few hours of play with an entertaining diversion from the main plot. The Gamemaster can improvise something, but, when he or she is at a loss for a scenario (or is just pressed for time), a mini-adventure might fit the bill. <\/p><p>The mini-adventures presented here cover a range of themes and challenge levels, including stakeouts, infiltrations, and the extraction of deep-cover spies from behind enemy lines. Each mini-adventure includes background on the events and challenges presented in the scenario, which the Gamemaster can use to construct a few \"Off-the-Cuff\" situations or as a jumping-off point for future encounters. <\/p><p>In addition, each mini-adventure also features a fully developed tactical encounter designed to serve as the climax of the scenario. The Gamemaster can use these encounters as written, alter the details to play to the heroes' strengths, or completely redesign them to fit the needs of the campaign. The Gamemaster can also reference these encounters when designing his or her own mini-adventures and scenarios. <\/p><p>These mini-adventures are designed to cater to different heroes' abilities, as well as the players' interests, within the realm of intrigue. For example, action-oriented heroes should appreciate \"<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/My_Enemy%27s_Enemy\" title=\"My Enemy's Enemy\">My Enemy's Enemy<\/a>,\" while stealthy and tech-savvy heroes will like \"<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arms_Dealers_Beware\" title=\"Arms Dealers Beware\">Arms Dealers Beware<\/a>.\" Heroes hoping to show off their espionage skills should enjoy \"<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Betrayal_at_Cloud_City\" title=\"Betrayal at Cloud City\">Betrayal at Cloud City<\/a>\" and \"<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Double_Down\" title=\"Double Down\">Double Down<\/a>.\" Similarly, \"<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Opportunity_Knocks\" title=\"Opportunity Knocks\">Opportunity Knocks<\/a>\" is aimed at heroic nobles, and the group's fast-talking con artist should find that \"<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shooting_Trouble\" title=\"Shooting Trouble\">Shooting Trouble<\/a>\" makes good use of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception\" title=\"Deception\">Deception<\/a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion\" title=\"Persuasion\">Persuasion<\/a>. Each mini-adventure in this chapter gives heroes of all <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Classes\" title=\"Heroic Classes\">Heroic Classes<\/a> a time to shine, even if the scenario is not aimed specifically at their competencies. <\/p><p>Although these mini-adventures are designed to be completely independent of one another, common threads run through all of them, allowing them to be strung together and run as a sort of \"Sub-Campaign\" within the main campaign. How they are used is purely up to the Gamemaster's discretion. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Perfect_Storm\">The Perfect Storm<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GoI_The_Perfect_Storm\" title=\"GoI The Perfect Storm\">The Perfect Storm<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>\"The Perfect Storm\" is an adventure for the <i>Star Wars Roleplaying Game<\/i>.

Many are driven by profit, working for interstellar conglomerates or private enterprises, in search of new resources or planets to exploit. Some seek refuge from a hostile government, a vengeful syndicate, or their own troubled past. However, no matter what drives beings to the wildest and least understood areas of the galaxy, they must rely on their own abilities and skills to survive. <\/p><p>When exploring The Unknown Regions, adaptable and diversely trained heroes perform best.

Although the best explorers can get by with the bare necessities of a breather and a blaster, only the reckless and the foolhardy venture out into the unknown expanses of the galaxy without the Equipment necessary to ensure both success and survival. Any veteran scout can tell you that when you're a million light-years away from civilization, your wits and your gear make the difference between accomplishing your mission and death.

Every explorer comes to rely on a core set of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment\" title=\"Equipment\">Equipment<\/a>, including <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons\" title=\"Weapons\">Weapons<\/a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor\" title=\"Armor\">Armor<\/a>, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles<\/a>. <\/p><p>Although a good explorer can find a use for almost any piece of Equipment, some pieces have become mainstays in the explorer's arsenal, varying little even when the political landscape changes drastically. Some Equipment can prove just as useful in civilized space as it can on some unknown chunk of dirt. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Exploration_Campaigns\">Exploration Campaigns<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Exploration_Campaigns\" title=\"UR Exploration Campaigns\">Exploration Campaigns<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>Every <i>Star Wars<\/i> film begins with the same words, which remind us that a galaxy full of adventure waits for us. Untold worlds exist beyond the many already known by name. Exotic creatures wait after the next hyperspace jump to aid or confound fife heroes. Every roleplaying session with your friends is an opportunity to explore new worlds together and create classic adventure stories. The galaxy is a big place. Every world is an adventure waiting to happen. <\/p><p>One of the great appeals of <i>Star Wars<\/i> is the exotic locations where stories can take place. Every planet seems familiar, yet has a unique element that makes it memorable. From the giant forests of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a> to the endless deserts of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine\" title=\"Tatooine\">Tatooine<\/a>, the worlds of the galaxy reinforce the familiar yet fantastic tone. <\/p><p>No matter the era of <i>Star Wars<\/i>, the galaxy offers thousands of unexplored worlds. Explorers continually push beyond the frontier and expand the fringe. Some operate as part of a governmental body, looking for worlds to colonize and conquer. Some operate as employees of galaxy-spanning companies that seek new worlds to exploit for profit. And others operate on their own in small, battered ships, trying to carve out a home in the spiraling void. <\/p><p>This chapter includes suggestions on how to make worlds that will resonate in your stories. It has resources and advice for building new worlds, as well as a planet generator to help when time or inspiration is lacking. It also suggests different ways to bring the theme of exploration to the forefront of your <i>Star Wars<\/i> campaign. And, because attitudes about exploration differ throughout the eras, summaries of those attitudes are included here. This chapter introduces two campaign outlines that have exploration as their central theme. Each of these campaigns offers suggestions on how to customize the campaign to best fit your play style. Also check out the tips and guidelines on how to include exploration as a theme in an ongoing campaign. <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Creating_New_Worlds\">Creating New Worlds<\/span><\/h3><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Creating_New_Worlds\" title=\"Creating New Worlds\">Creating New Worlds<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>Encountering new worlds is central to Unknown Regions adventures. New worlds should be only as detailed as the adventure goals require. Some planets might require superficial descriptions, but others might need significant details for an extended stay or adventure. This section includes two methods of world creation: building a planet from scratch (Mainly for detailed worlds), or using the Planet Generator to create simpler worlds quickly or on the fly. <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Creating_New_Beasts\">Creating New Beasts<\/span><\/h3><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Creating_New_Beasts\" title=\"Creating New Beasts\">Creating New Beasts<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>The galaxy teems with life, and most sentient beings encounter only a tiny fraction of the creatures of their own homeworld, let alone the galaxy at large. Heroes traveling <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a> should regularly discover, fight, and otherwise interact with creatures they have never seen before. <\/p><p>In this section, you'll find a step-by-step guide through the Beast Creation process. If you need a simple Beast quickly, use the Creature Generator that follows this section.

If you want to create a new <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mount\">Mount<\/a>, consider modifying one of the existing <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mounts\" title=\"Mounts\">Mounts<\/a> with information from this section. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Creating_New_Hazards\">Creating New Hazards<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Creating_New_Hazards\" title=\"UR Creating New Hazards\">Creating New Hazards<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>The galaxy is full of obstacles waiting to trip up heroes as they strive to fulfill their destinies. Every planet has its own perils- whether menacing plant life, an unsafe atmosphere, or something worse- and any explorer can confirm that the greatest danger when traveling to a new world is encountering some new Hazard not yet known to the galaxy at large. Stormtroopers and Sith Lords are obvious threats to the safety of just about everyone, but it is often the unseen and unexpected Hazards that bring heroes down. <\/p><p>Hazards, first introduced in the <i>Saga Edition Core Rulebook<\/i>, appear throughout <i>Star Wars<\/i> films, novels, comics, and other sources. Until now, Hazards have been basic rules elements used to address a variety of situations that might come up during a game. This chapter's goal is to make Hazards more appealing as a regular part of adventure and encounter design. When the heroes visit strange worlds in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a>, they should feel as if every step could lead them into dangerous territory. By using Hazards more frequently, you can emphasize the fact that the heroes are far from home in a place where many of the galaxy's niceties simply are not present.&nbsp; <\/p><p>This chapter introduces a new format for Hazards, along with rules for designing your own Hazards and suggestions for using them in your adventures. Additionally, the chapter provides many sample Hazards that are ready to be used in a game; these examples also will help guide you in creating your own Hazards. The samples are grouped by environment, so you can choose Hazards appropriate to the setting and level of your adventure and drop them in as needed. <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Designing_New_Hazards\">Designing New Hazards<\/span><\/h3><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Designing_New_Hazards\" title=\"UR Designing New Hazards\">Designing New Hazards<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>Designing Hazards is much like designing new terrain or other challenges that can spice up an encounter or an adventure. Unlike the process for designing an enemy character, Beast, Droid, or Vehicle, the process for designing a new Hazard is somewhat simpler, and it helps you cater directly to the needs of your particular adventure by creating elements that add diversity to encounters. You can follow a series of basic steps to design a Hazard that challenges your players and makes sense in the context of the adventure. <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sample_Hazards\">Sample Hazards<\/span><\/h3><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Sample_Hazards\" title=\"UR Sample Hazards\">Sample Hazards<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>The remainder of this chapter presents sample Hazards that should give you enough examples and guidelines to help you design your own Hazards. The section below starts with Hazards from <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hazards\" title=\"Hazards\">Hazards<\/a> article, which have been reformatted using the rules in this chapter, then it explores new Hazards based on environment. Some of the Hazards from the <i>Core Rulebook<\/i> do not exactly conform to the suggested Hazard attack and damage numbers, but have been reproduced in the new format for ease of use. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Threats\">Threats<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Threats\" title=\"UR Threats\">Threats<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>Hidden from the rest of the, galaxy, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a> hold many <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> capable of interstellar travel. Their initial contact with civilizations of known space is often difficult and violent. Even after a group emerges from the darkness of the unknown and meets others, it takes years to establish a mutual understanding of cultures, protocols, and spheres of influence. Formal relations usually develop slowly, although ad-hoc, emergency, or informal agreements can serve both sides in the short term. <\/p><p>This chapter describes some of the most prominent threats of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a> and the era in which they were revealed to the galaxy. However, explorers from known. space might encounter them decades or millennia earlier. Gamemasters should feel free to adapt the threats to meet the needs of games set in previous eras. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Planets\">Planets<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Planets\" title=\"UR Planets\">Planets<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>Planets of every type and description exist throughout the galaxy, and the worlds of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a> are inherently mysterious to explorers and adventurers. These planets are untamed, and all hold their own secrets. Some provide environmental challenges, pitting heroes against natural hazards and hostile creatures. Others are home to previously unknown civilizations that have their own internal struggles and conflicts. <\/p><p>This chapter includes eight new worlds created specifically for use in a <i>Saga Edition<\/i> campaign. For the heroes, these planets are truly fresh locales, and the only way to learn about these worlds is to explore them- players will not find them in any movies, novels, or comics. Although the planets are new, each embodies the distinctive feel of <i>Star Wars<\/i>. These planets are meant to serve as new places the heroes can explore during their first trips into <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a>. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Deep_Space_Encounters\">Deep Space Encounters<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Deep_Space_Encounters\" title=\"UR Deep Space Encounters\">Deep Space Encounters<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>This chapter is intended for Gamemasters and contains several mini-adventures best used with heroes in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a>. If you are a player, you probably should skip this chapter and wait for your Gamemaster to spring these adventures on you and the other players in your group. <\/p><p>Occasionally, heroes take a tangent that their Gamemaster had not planned for, or the Gamemaster needs to fill a few hours of play with an entertaining diversion from the main plot. The Gamemaster can improvise something, but, when he or she is at a loss for a scenario (Or is just pressed for time), a mini-adventure might fit the bill. <\/p><p>The Deep Space Encounters presented here take place on or around the planets covered in Chapter 6: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/UR_Planets\" title=\"UR Planets\">Planets<\/a>. Exploration of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a> is an integral part of the mini-adventures. The encounters available in this chapter cover a wide range of Challenge Levels and plots, including exploring an abandoned space station, rescuing a stranded pilot, freeing a victim from the clutches of a cult, and tracking down an ancient and dangerous Sith Artifact. Each adventure includes an outline of the events and challenges in the adventure, which the Gamemaster can use to construct a few \"Off-the-Cuff\" situations- or as a jumping-off point for future encounters. <\/p><p>In addition, each mini-adventure also features a fully developed tactical encounter designed to serve as the climax of the scenario. The Gamemaster can use these encounters as written, alter the details to play to the heroes' strengths, or completely redesign them to fit the needs of the campaign. The Gamemaster can also reference these encounters when designing his or her own mini-adventures and scenarios. <\/p><p>Although these Deep Space Encounters are designed to be completely independent of one another, common threads run through all of them, allowing them to be strung together and run as a minor campaign within the main campaign. How they are used is purely up to the Gamemaster's discretion. <\/p>"

Our first exposure to the Star Wars saga began with the war between <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance<\/a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire\" title=\"The Galactic Empire\">The Galactic Empire<\/a>, and the stories of heroes from a galaxy far, far away almost fall against the backdrop of armed conflict. From the ancient Great Hyperspace War to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Civil_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Civil War\">The Jedi Civil War<\/a>, from the Clone Wars through <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith-Imperial_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Sith-Imperial War\">The Sith-Imperial War<\/a>, time has been marked in the galaxy not by its long-standing ears of peace, but by its tranquility-shattering periods of war. Nearly every great tale of heroism and villainy comes with galaxy-spanning conflict as a part of its story, and the same goes for the stories of heroes in the <i>Star Wars Roleplaying Game<\/i>. <\/p><p><i>Galaxy at War<\/i> is dedicated to bringing the same kinds of epic conflict to your adventures and campaigns. Inside these articles you will find a virtual toolbox full of material that you can use to give your adventures a backdrop fitting for a setting focused on warfare. <i>Galaxy at War<\/i> is all about bringing a strong militaristic feeling to your adventures, whether your heroes are part of a military unit engaged in war or simply swept up as unwilling pawns in a galactic conflict. With <i>Galaxy at War<\/i>, you should be able to take a campaign set during any of the wars throughout the galaxy's history and create a campaign that makes your heroes feel like they are directly contributing to the outcome of that conflict. <\/p><p>Players using <i>Galaxy at War<\/i> will find inspiration not only for their heroes' origins, but also for their <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destinies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destinies\">Destinies<\/a>. <i>Galaxy at War<\/i> helps players get into a military mindset, so that they can bring their heroes (Soldiers and otherwise) to life. Players with characters of any class in a war-themed campaign should find plenty of things to use in <i>Galaxy at War<\/i>, including new ideas for character histories, weapons, and equipment. Moreover, these articles can be a great inspiration for an entire group of players looking to find ways to bring their heroes together and form bonds that will last through an entire campaign; nothing ensures loyalty like going into the fire together and coming out the other side alive. <\/p><p>Gamemasters will find not only sample adventures but also advice for creating and maintaining military adventures and campaigns. <i>Galaxy at War<\/i> can serve as a tool kit for putting together military adventures, from the pre-mission briefing all the way through the post-combat breakdown and mission analysis. <i>Galaxy at War<\/i> provides not only advice for running military-themed campaigns (Including the archetypal military campaign, in which the heroes play characters who are members of the Imperial military), but also provides small details and subtle touches, like military jargon and NPC personality qualities, that can help GMs transform adventures from standard mission-based games into exciting and in-depth war epics. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Military_Heroes\">Military Heroes<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article:<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_Military_Heroes\" title=\"GaW Military Heroes\"> Military Heroes<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>For over a thousand generations <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Order\">The Jedi Order<\/a> has guarded the peace throughout the galaxy. Even so, key eras of the <i>Star Wars<\/i> saga are ravaged by war, offering Gamemasters opportunities for campaigns focusing on warfare and the military. The heroes of a military campaign fight in battles, but they also can be the characters around which the war turns. In many cases, the actions of such heroes not only decide battles but also determine the fate of entire systems and sectors. Billions of lives hang in the balance, and the heroes' actions can determine the final outcome of entire wars. The heroes of a military campaign are not simply combatants, they are agents of destiny. <\/p><p>The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier\" title=\"Soldier\">Soldier<\/a> class is well suited for a military campaign. <i>Galaxy at War<\/i> introduces new options specifically geared for characters who take levels in the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier\" title=\"Soldier\">Soldier<\/a> class, including those who only have a few levels of the class. Additionally, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier\" title=\"Soldier\">Soldier<\/a> class encompases a wide variety of archetypes within the military theme: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soldiers\">Soldiers<\/a> can be covert-ops warriors, military police, officers-in-training, mercenaries, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Starfighter\">Starfighter<\/a> pilots, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gunners\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gunners\">Gunners<\/a>, martial arts masters, and much, much more. <i>Galaxy at War<\/i> helps players and Gamemasters use the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier\" title=\"Soldier\">Soldier<\/a> class to greater potential, illuminating new paths for combat archetypes. <\/p><p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soldiers\">Soldiers<\/a> are not the only participants in warfare. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nobles\">Nobles<\/a> recruit and command troops, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scoundrels\">Scoundrels<\/a> raid supply lines and ambush unsuspecting troops; <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scouts\">Scouts<\/a> prepare entire armies for the battles they are about to face; and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi\" title=\"Jedi\">Jedi<\/a> bring the power of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a> to combat. Heroes of these classes can find new <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents\" title=\"Talents\">Talents<\/a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats\" title=\"Feats\">Feats<\/a> in this chapter, and elsewhere in <i>Galaxy at War<\/i> can find new material to hive heroes a distinctly military edge. Heroes of all classes are affected by the tides of war, and <i>Galaxy at War<\/i> presents several new options that reflect how involvement in galaxywide war changes those characters. <\/p><p>Much of the discussion in <i>Galaxy at War<\/i> uses the word \"Military\" to represent a general theme of a faction involved in a war. The term is not reserved only for organized factions such as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic\" title=\"The Galactic Republic\">The Galactic Republic<\/a> or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire\" title=\"The Galactic Empire\">The Galactic Empire<\/a>, but also covers any paramilitary or combat-oriented group. Highly organized and militant pirate groups, mercenary bands, support forces, and even individual adventuring parties all fall under this banner. Military heroes are not required to be signed up for the armed forces of a major government, although typically they are members of an organized force with a rank structure and protocols of behavior focusing on combat and warfare. <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Military_Heroes_2\">Military Heroes<\/span><\/h3><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Military_Heroes\" title=\"Military Heroes\">Military Heroes<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>Life on the battlefield can be intense, terrifying, exhilarating, or short.

These effects can be offensive or defensive and can be used by the Gamemaster either to help or to hinder the heroes. <\/p><p>Battlefield Effects are special auras that can be applied to any nonstarship <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vehicle\">Vehicle<\/a> that meets the prerequisites. A Battlefield Effect lasts until the end of the Vehicle's next turn. A Vehicle can only have one Battlefield Effect at a time, and the effect is determined prior to an encounter. Giving a Battlefield Effect to a Vehicle requires no modifications to its weapons, armor, or other systems. <\/p><p>To use a Battlefield Effect, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Commander\" title=\"Commander\">Commander<\/a> of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vehicle\">Vehicle<\/a> takes a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Standard Action\">Standard Action<\/a> and the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vehicle\">Vehicle<\/a> can make no attacks until the start of the Commander's next turn.

Soldiers rarely carry their personal gear and weapons into battle and instead rely on their military units to outfit them with the gear necessary for battle. In addition to three square meals a day and a cot, one advantage to serving in a regular army or mercenary unit is access to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons\" title=\"Weapons\">Weapons<\/a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment\" title=\"Equipment\">Equipment<\/a>, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles<\/a> that are beyond the reaches of civilians. A well-equipped and well-funded army or mercenary outfit is assumed to have gear, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles<\/a>, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids\" title=\"Droids\">Droids<\/a> appropriate to their faction and era. In most cases, the average soldier has access to gear and equipment far beyond what would normally be available to a character by using the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Money\" title=\"Money\">Money<\/a> system. <\/p><p>Gear Requisition is a set of optional rules that replaces that standard system of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Money\" title=\"Money\">Money<\/a>. The Gear Requisition system gives players in a <i>Galaxy at War<\/i> campaign access to bigger and better weapons, armor, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles<\/a>, and even <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starships\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Starships\">Starships<\/a> that would exceed the limits of their personal wealth. However, the equipment that the heroes requisition does not belong to them and must be returned to the army or mercenary company's quartermaster at the end of the adventure. When the heroes are off duty or not otherwise working on behalf of their units, they must rely on their own weapons and gear to survive. <\/p><p>Requisitioned Gear is distinct from gear assigned for a specific mission. Requisitioned Gear can be used in any way that the hero sees fit, just like personal gear. Heroes who requisition gear for a mission might receive additional unique, mission-specific items or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles<\/a> that would otherwise exceed their requisition budget. However, gear assigned for a mission must be used in accordance with the mission's parameters. A soldier is both responsible and accountable for gear assigned as part of a mission, and reckless endangerment or destruction of this equipment could result in harsh discipline. For example, the heroes might be ordered to transport an experimental weapon to the battlefield, but the weapon is not theirs to deploy unless given direct permission. Also, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starships\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Starships\">Starships<\/a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles\" title=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles<\/a> that ferry the heroes to and from locations and do not otherwise accompany the heroes after drop off are not considered part of a requisition budget. <\/p><p>If you utilize this system in your campaign, then the heroes should receive only one-half the usual rewards in credits that they would otherwise gain (See <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gamemastering\" title=\"Gamemastering\">Gamemastering<\/a>). Heroes in a military-themed campaign are fighting for the prestige and glory, not the credits, and if they choose to leave their military organization, they discover that life as a civilian comes without access to the best gear, weapons, and gadgets that soldiers enjoy. <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rank_and_Privilege\">Rank and Privilege<\/span><\/h3><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rank_and_Privilege\" title=\"Rank and Privilege\">Rank and Privilege<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>A hero who serves in an army, a planetary defense organization, or a mercenary group is given a rank here called a title. With a title comes authority to give orders, access to equipment and personnel, and increased pay. However, the greater a hero's title is, the greater are the accountability, responsibilities, and demands placed on him or her. The <i>Star Wars Roleplaying Game<\/i> is about action, however, not administrative paperwork or Boards of Inquiry, so heroes in the game are allowed more leeway than actual members of the military would ever hope for. A title is usually indicative of character level and experience, but a title can be based on social status and other noncombat-oriented factors. Heroes often receive orders from officers who are superior in rank but considerably lower in level-sometimes having only <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nonheroic\" title=\"Nonheroic\">Nonheroic<\/a> levels. <\/p><p>The Rank and Privilege system is based on and is compatible with the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Organization\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Organization\">Organization<\/a> system described in the <i><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Force Unleashed Campaign Guide\">Force Unleashed Campaign Guide<\/a><\/i>, and it also stands on its own as an independent optional system. Gamemasters using both these systems should determine the scale, organization type, and positive and negative criteria for specific military organizations in their campaigns. <\/p><p>The Rank and Privilege system provided here gives a character's title and the corresponding additional in-game abilities and bonus for requisitioning equipment (See <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gear_Requisition\" title=\"Gear Requisition\">Gear Requisition<\/a>). As a player advances in title, he or she also gains access to additional benefits. With title also comes authority, and as such, heroes add the appropriate Command Bonus score to any <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion\" title=\"Persuasion\">Persuasion<\/a> checks when dealing with members of their military organization (See below). <\/p><p>Military organizations follow a strict chain of command, with clear regulations on rank, responsibility, and authority of each soldier in its command. Soldiers are expected to follow the orders without question, and officers expect that their orders are carried out quickly and efficiently by those under their command. Depending on the military organization, era, and even duty post, soldiers can advance rapidly through the ranks or can make themselves career foot soldiers or noncommissioned officers. The table below includes the most common ranks found in military groups throughout the galaxy. Depending on the branch, some of the titles might be different or might not exist at all. For simplicity's sake, the titles given apply to both ground and naval forces. Gamemasters are free to alter the titles as needed. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Military_Campaigns\">Military Campaigns<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article:<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_Military_Campaigns\" title=\"GaW Military Campaigns\"> Military Campaigns<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>Military Campaigns can portray the heroics of a high-flying <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Starfighter\">Starfighter<\/a> squadron or the trials and tribulations of a special-forces unit wallowing in the mud. The most important difference between a Military Campaign and a more conventional one is the mood and tone. Military Campaigns are structured. Even though the morality of the conflict might be unclear, the objectives are well defined. <\/p><p>Winning a war requires teamwork, planning, and the skills to get the job done. Discipline is also important, because it provides a structure for the military machine. Even the lowliest trooper is expected to follow orders. If the trooper refuses to do so, the ripples of the insubordination can be felt even in the highest echelons. <\/p><p>This chapter explains how to establish the necessary tone and mood of a Military Campaign and how to convey to the heroes that they are a part of a conflict that is much larger than any individual solder. In addition, you can learn about military characters and what makes them tick. <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Imperial_Campaign\">The Imperial Campaign<\/span><\/h3><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Imperial_Campaign\" title=\"The Imperial Campaign\">The Imperial Campaign<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>During <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Rebellion Era\">The Rebellion Era<\/a>, the largest, most powerful, and most cohesive military force is controlled by the Empire. The increased militarization started by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during the Clone Wars is enhanced by fierce nationalism, xenophobia, and fears of destabilization. Constant warfare keeps the Imperial military in a heightened state of readiness for decades, and insurgent uprisings on a number of worlds sharpen the skills of Imperial officers and the troops that serve beneath them. <\/p><p>Thousands of military vessels crewed by millions of loyal Imperial troops cruise space in defense of the Empire. They possess the best weapons and equipment available, along with the tenacity and training to use them to the best effect. In addition, Emperor Palpatine- a charismatic and seemingly selfless leader- has made it his goal to see that their way of life is not tarnished by corruption, terrorism, or the threat of primitive and debauched non-<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> societies. <\/p><p>How can they lose? <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Battlefield_Encounter_Tool_Kit\">Battlefield Encounter Tool Kit<\/span><\/h3><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Battlefield_Encounter_Tool_Kit\" title=\"Battlefield Encounter Tool Kit\">Battlefield Encounter Tool Kit<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>The battlefields of the <i>Star Wars<\/i> universe are many and varied, so the tactics of enemies and allies should not be limited to routine assault or defense. Methods of warfare can be codified and civil or brutal and barbaric, but the aim is always the same- victory. When the price of victory becomes secondary to victory itself, all bets are off. <\/p><p>This Battlefield Encounter Tool Kit features various rules and options for spicing up the battlefields of your military campaigns. Some of the rules presented here might prove deadly to unprepared heroes. You are advised to use them with care. <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mission_Generator\">Mission Generator<\/span><\/h3><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_Generator\" title=\"Mission Generator\">Mission Generator<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>You might have a clear idea of the types of missions you want to send the heroes on. However, the Mission Generator can help to formulate a basic concept from which you can extrapolate more concrete details for a specific mission. To use the generator, roll a d20 and consult the table below. Each Mission type is briefly described in their respective section, along with criteria to determine Mission success. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Military_Units\">Military Units<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_Military_Units\" title=\"GaW Military Units\">Military Units<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>Many will claim that wars are fought by individual soldiers, and that a single person's contribution can turn the tides of battles and even of entire wars. That may be true, but typically wars area carried out not by individuals, but by factions. Within most conflicts, those factions are broken down into even smaller groups, often known as Military Units. This chapter details fifteen unique Military Units drawn from across the breadth of the <i>Star Wars<\/i> saga, from the ancient days of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Sith_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Great Sith War\">The Great Sith War<\/a> all the way up through the fight against the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong\" title=\"Yuuzhan Vong\">Yuuzhan Vong<\/a> invaders. <\/p><p>Some units are part of a larger military structure, but still retain a great deal of autonomy. Although organizations such as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Katarn_Commandos\" title=\"The Katarn Commandos\">The Katarn Commandos<\/a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wraith_Squadron\" title=\"Wraith Squadron\">Wraith Squadron<\/a> answer to their New Republic and Galactic Alliance superiors, they still choose their own missions, create their own plans, and execute those plans according to their own standards. Other units aren't part of militaries at all; for example, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mistryl_Shadow_Guard\" title=\"The Mistryl Shadow Guard\">The Mistryl Shadow Guard<\/a> is an organization unto itself, and though beholden to the Eleven Elders of the People it answers to no higher military authority other than its own leaders. <\/p><p>Heroes can choose to use these organizations as a part of their characters' histories or simply as models for creating their own, similar organizations. Having the heroes all choose a single unit as their organization makes it very easy for both the players and the Gamemaster to justify why heroes of such disparate skills and personalities might be working together. Serving as members of the same Military Unit is a great way for heroes to find common ground without having to resort to elaborate descriptions of how each hero knows each other hero and why they would all be working together. Moreover, having the heroes all be members of the same Military Unit makes it much easier to design adventures for those heroes, as they all have common (If not identical) goals and motivations. <\/p><p>By the same token, these Military Units can be used as allies and antagonists for heroes in any campaign, not just those with a military theme. Each Military Unit in this chapter contains information on its goals, methods, rank structure, and missions to give the Gamemaster a solid idea of how the organization functions and what its members could be like. When creating NPC allies and antagonists, using these Military Units is a great way to give an adventure a warfare-based twist without having to alter the structure of the entire adventure. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bases_and_Battlestations\">Bases and Battlestations<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article:<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_Bases_and_Battlestations\" title=\"GaW Bases and Battlestations\"> Bases and Battlestations<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>No military campaign is complete without missions to infiltrate, sabotage, or destroy the opposing force's base of operations.

This chapter covers everything the Gamemaster needs to create exciting adventuring sites- hereafter referred to generically as \"Battlestations\"- from basic concepts all the way through encounter design. <\/p><p>A Battlestation is more than just a Death Star or some other massive superweapon. In this chapter, the term \"Battlestation\" means a fortified and actively defended location where adventures will take place. A Battlestation can come in many forms, whether it is a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Station\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Space Station\">Space Station<\/a>, a ground installation, or a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ship\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Capital Ship\">Capital Ship<\/a>. <\/p><p>Of course, before the villains can wreak havoc with a Battlestation of the heroes can commandeer it for their own noble purposes, the place has to be built. This chapter not only covers the basic rules for assigning statistical values to the various aspects of a Battlestation, but also introduces factors that affect a station in the game. Moreover, it includes specific environment rules for creating encounters on Battlestations. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Military_Encounters\">Military Encounters<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_Military_Encounters\" title=\"GaW Military Encounters\">Military Encounters<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>This chapter is intended for Gamemasters and contains several mini-adventures ideally suited for military-style encounters.

A hero might be a Jedi Knight, sworn to protect the Republic but reeling from losses in previous wars. Another hero might be a Republic soldier on the front lines of battle, fighting with every ounce of effort to hold the line against Mandalorian invaders. One hero might be an arms dealer smuggling weapons to resistance cells on Sith-controlled worlds, while another might be a Hyperspace explorer that stumbles across a secret rallying point for the forces of the Republic. A hero might be a corporate agent overseeing the construction of vital defense systems, or a Jedi Shadow working behind the scenes to bring down a sinister villain. Whatever your hero's history and speciality, an <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Republic_Campaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Old Republic Campaign\">Old Republic Campaign<\/a> is rife with opportunities to send ripples of influence throughout the galaxy. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Species\">Species<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/KotORCG_Species\" title=\"KotORCG Species\">Species<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>In the days of the Old Republic, as in all <i>Star Wars<\/i> eras, a variety of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> thrive throughout the galaxy.

But around the year 28,000 BBY, the archetypal model of ambition rises to power among them. This inflexible Sith ruler unites his world into a single kingdom, and claims the titles of both monarch and god of his people. History calls him King Adas, but according to legend, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a> bristows on him a different name: <i>Sith'ari<\/i>- the perfect being. <\/p><p>Three thousand years before the founding of the Republic, Adas' hegemony is invaded by <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Infinite_Empire\" title=\"The Infinite Empire\">The Infinite Empire<\/a>, an immensely powerful interstellar nation. Here, later Sith would say, they prove their right to rule the galaxy. Outsmarting the technologically superior invaders, Adas conquers the conquerors, sacrificing his life in the process. With the aliens' technology, The Sith prosper, colonizing nearby worlds and even banishing a group of pureblooded <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Offshoot\" title=\"Sith Offshoot\">Sith<\/a> as far away as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tund\" title=\"Tund\">Tund<\/a>. But there is a greater gift <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Infinite_Empire\" title=\"The Infinite Empire\">The Infinite Empire<\/a> bequeathed to The Sith- <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side<\/a> of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a>. <\/p><p>Eventually, The Sith are again visited by aliens, this time by Dark Jedi exiled in the Hundred-Year Darkness. These exiles, initially called <i>Jen'jidai<\/i> in the Sith tongue, easily conquer the reigning Sith overlord, earning their leader Ajunta Pall the title <i>Jen'ari<\/i> or \"Dark Lord\" of the Sith. Though a number of these Sith conquerors follow their leaders back to Republic space for revenge against <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi<\/a>, many stay to interbreed with The Sith by alchemical means. For the next two thousand years, Jedi blood mixes with Sith, breeding out feeble characteristics of each <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>- such as superstition, sympathy, and loyalty- while sharpening desirable qualities such as ambition, cunning, and raw power in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a>. At last, around the year 5,000 BBY, The Sith Empire, led by the Dark Lord Naga Sadow, is ready and invades Republic space. <\/p><p>Because of treason, the Sith campaign fails, and special enforcers called <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Shadows\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jedi Shadows\">Jedi Shadows<\/a> zealously eradicate every last vestige of The Sith they find. But in a twist of irony, a few short centuries later, the Jedi Knight Freedon Nadd finds two Sith relics the Shadows missed. Taking instruction from both King Adas' Holocron and Sadow's disembodied spirit, Nadd becomes a Dark Lord. In turn, he inculcates the Jedi Exar Kun into The Sith creed, consequently bringing the Republic to its knees as Kun's Brotherhood of the Sith instigates <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Sith_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Great Sith War\">The Great Sith War<\/a>. <\/p><p>Kun's Brotherhood is defeated, and in another blow, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mecrosa_Order\" title=\"The Mecrosa Order\">The Mecrosa Order<\/a>, a long-time Sith bastion, overplays its hand in the Tapani Sector and is completely annihilated in The Cleansing of the Nine Houses. Still, The Sith need never fear extinction again.

Archaic wardrobe is in vogue during a brief revival that spans much of the Republic. Wealth coalesces in the hands of the few, including the Tapani dynasties and families with such names as Adasca, Zentine, Vanjervalis, and Draay. And the Republic sees <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Order\">The Jedi Order<\/a> as a lifeline to the past, as a force for good. <\/p><p><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Sith_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Great Sith War\">The Great Sith War<\/a> changes everything. This \"Internal squabble over Jedi beliefs,\" as reporters first characterized it, takes untold lives and damages over 25% of the Republic's infrastructure. Though <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Sith_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Great Sith War\">The Great Sith War<\/a> begins seemingly as an internal conflict within the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Empress_Teta\" title=\"Empress Teta\">Empress Teta<\/a> System, the chaos spreads outward from <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Deep_Core\" title=\"The Deep Core\">The Deep Core<\/a> at an incredible rate. When <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians\" title=\"The Mandalorians\">The Mandalorians<\/a> join the war, the Republic nearly finds itself overwhelmed, and attacks on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a> and other important worlds drive the real danger of this war home. While the Republic lets <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi<\/a> deal with their traitorous comrades, the Republic military battles Mandalorians on one front and Krath warriors on another, trying to keep from being torn apart. After years of grueling conflict where worlds are leveled and the Republic is placed on the brink of total destruction, the tide turns, and eventually, with the help of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi<\/a>, the Republic wins the day. <\/p><p>The results of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Sith_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Great Sith War\">The Great Sith War<\/a> are devastating. Entire worlds have been blasted back to pre-Hyperspace technology levels. Entire sectors vanish from communications channels, and go for months at a time without any news of their survival reaching the central systems of the Republic. Trade routes blazed over millennia require redevelopment at every stop. Piracy is rampant. The Republic, just as much a financial compact as a deliberate institution, fails to deliver on the basic premises of its creation. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Mandalorians\">The Mandalorians<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/KotORCG_The_Mandalorians\" title=\"KotORCG The Mandalorians\">The Mandalorians<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p><i>Affiliation Page: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians\" title=\"The Mandalorians\">The Mandalorians<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>The Mandalorians are not a race, but a movement.

Darth Bane resurrected the cult so that there could only be two- no more, no less; a master and an apprentice.

When that apprentice succeeded him, that new Sith Lord would take an apprentice. Thus, The Sith quietly continued for centuries, until the time of Darth Sidious. With great cunning and treachery, Sidious fomented a galactic civil war within the Republic, seized control of the Galactic Senate, wiped out <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Order\">The Jedi Order<\/a>, and replaced <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic\" title=\"The Galactic Republic\">The Galactic Republic<\/a> with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire\" title=\"The Galactic Empire\">The Galactic Empire<\/a>. With Sidious as the Emperor and Darth Vader as his loyal apprentice, The Sith ruled the galaxy and plunged it into darkness.

Following his capture, the Republic begins an offensive that drives the forces of the Sith back, eventually shattering the Krath forces, routing <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians\" title=\"The Mandalorians\">The Mandalorians<\/a>, and scattering the few remaining Sith to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.

By guaranteeing the various corporations throughout the galaxy safe passage and trade along the space lanes in exchange for commercial investment in the Republic's infrastructure, the Republic is able to rebuild its military and provide much-needed goods to the devastated people of the galaxy. Hyperspace explorers once again begin scouting the galaxy in earnest, discovering newer and safer routes.

The two cousins and a number of other rich and spoiled aristocrats taught themselves a bit of Sith magic from artifacts recovered by Jedi Master Odan-Urr during <span class=\"new\" title=\"The Great Hyperspace War (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVGhlX0dyZWF0X0h5cGVyc3BhY2VfV2FyP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\">The Great Hyperspace War<\/span> a thousand years earlier. The group calls themselves The Krath, a name based on the fearsome creature of legend. After recovering a book of Sith secrets from a museum on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a>, the cousins proceeded to the planet <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Onderon\" title=\"Onderon\">Onderon<\/a>, which was in the midst of a revolt by supporters of the ancient Sith Lord Freedon Nadd. <\/p><p>The spirit of Freedon Nadd had been working with Onderon's King Ommin to sustain <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith<\/a>. However, Nadd realizes that the King is on the brink of defeat by Jedi and Republic forces, so he transfers his support to Satal and Aleema, promising to guide them into a new Sith Golden Age. The cousins escape <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Onderon\" title=\"Onderon\">Onderon<\/a> and return to the Empress Teta System, where they stage a coup to take control of the seven worlds. However, the populace revolts, resulting in a systemwide struggle in which The Krath unleash their new Sith powers, including impressive Sith sorcery and large-scale illusions. The Krath also skirmish with Jedi forces, using their <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Krath_War_Droids\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Krath War Droids\">Krath War Droids<\/a> in a preemptive strike that results in the death of Master Arca. <\/p><p>The death of Master Arca has a profound impact on Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma. He pledges to bring down The Krath from the inside, by posing as a fallen Jedi. Ultimately, Ulic is seduced into joining <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side<\/a> by Aleema, killing Satal in the process and taking his place as one of the rulers of The Krath. In his new position, he finds himself battling the Jedi forces who sought to save him from The Krath deceptions. During a climactic battle, Exar Kun appears and engages Ulic in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lightsaber\">Lightsaber<\/a> combat. At that moment, the spirit of the Dark Lord of the Sith Marka Ragnos appears, drawn by the Sith amulets both combatants wear. The Sith spirit orders the two to join forces so that they can bring about the predicted return of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith<\/a>. <\/p><p>The two become allies. Exar Kun follows his own path to create Sith converts from <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi<\/a>. Ulic leads the military of The Krath, joining them with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians\" title=\"The Mandalorians\">The Mandalorians<\/a> after defeating Mandalore the Indomitable in single combat. The battles rage across the galaxy, including <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a>. Aleema falls as she triggers the destruction of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ossus\" title=\"Ossus\">Ossus<\/a>, betrayed by Ulic for her lack of loyalty. Eventually Ulic realizes his mistake in following <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side<\/a>, but only after he kills his brother Clay, and Nomi Sunrider blinds him to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a>.

They are successful, though unaware that Kun's spirit survives, trapped within one of his temples. The remaining Krath forces are destroyed or scattered.

Rather than avoiding <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side<\/a>, The Krath have no such inhibitions and follow their investigations in any direction they deem worthy. They learn how to use ancient <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Artifacts\" title=\"Sith Artifacts\">Sith Artifacts<\/a>, project massive and destructive Sith illusions, and wield Sith sorcery. <\/p><p>Those Krath that survive the end of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Sith_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Great Sith War\">The Great Sith War<\/a> are scattered in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim\" title=\"The Outer Rim\">The Outer Rim<\/a>, mainly in regions around <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban\" title=\"Korriban\">Korriban<\/a>.

Trained as a Jedi Knight, Hett manages to survive Order 66 by escaping his Clone Troopers and slaying them. As Palpatine's Empire rises, Hett returns to his home planet where he clashes with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi\" title=\"Obi-Wan Kenobi\">Obi-Wan Kenobi<\/a> who, unbeknownst to Hett, has been watching over the infant <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker\" title=\"Luke Skywalker\">Luke Skywalker<\/a>.

For a short while, Hett works as a bounty hunter, until one day he pursues a bounty to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban\" title=\"Korriban\">Korriban<\/a>. Once there, Hett stumbles upon an ancient <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Holocron\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sith Holocron\">Sith Holocron<\/a> and begins to learn the secrets of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith<\/a>.

Trapped aboard a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong\" title=\"Yuuzhan Vong\">Yuuzhan Vong<\/a> ship, Hett encounters another former Jedi, Vergere. Subjected to torment in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong\" title=\"Yuuzhan Vong\">Yuuzhan Vong<\/a> torture devices, Hett allows Vergere's words to seduce him into surrendering to his agony and to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side<\/a>. During his torment, Hett begins to have visions of a new Sith Order and a galaxy under his control. Eventually, Hett frees himself from the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong\" title=\"Yuuzhan Vong\">Yuuzhan Vong<\/a> and makes his way back to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban\" title=\"Korriban\">Korriban<\/a>, whereupon he adopts a new Sith name: Darth Krayt.

His influence expands, but when it becomes clear that he cannot live long enough to fulfill his vision, Darth Krayt begins placing himself in stasis, issuing his orders telepathically while artificially extending his lifespan with a combination of healing trances and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bio-Implants\" title=\"Bio-Implants\">Bio-Implants<\/a>. In the meantime, his new Sith Order has forged an important alliance with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emperor_Roan_Fel\" title=\"Emperor Roan Fel\">Emperor Roan Fel<\/a>, lending their aid in the defeat of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Alliance\" title=\"The Galactic Alliance\">The Galactic Alliance<\/a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi<\/a>. <\/p><p>By the end of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith-Imperial_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Sith-Imperial War\">The Sith-Imperial War<\/a>, Darth Krayt declares himself Emperor.

Furthermore, healing trances and Force healing become less effective. Darth Krayt knows that his time is limited unless a new solution is found.

As the former homeworld of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith<\/a>, Korriban is riddled with thousands of tombs, catacombs, caves, and temples dedicated to fallen Sith Lords from ages past. The planet is harsh and desolate, continually under the pall of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side<\/a>, which has tainted every rock, plant, and animal. Its long history is full of evil acts, forbidden knowledge, and other terrible things. Depending on the era of the campaign, Korriban could be either bustling with activity or a desolate and lonely wasteland, haunted by the whispers of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side<\/a>. <\/p><p>When Korriban was populated, its capital was Dreshdae, a violent and despicable place where survival of the fittest held sway. After <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Sith_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Great Sith War\">The Great Sith War<\/a>, mercenaries were common in Dreshdae, in addition to smugglers and bounty hunters who found the lawless nature of the place suitable to their taste. During <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Old Republic Era\">The Old Republic Era<\/a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Czerka_Corporation\" title=\"The Czerka Corporation\">The Czerka Corporation<\/a> established their sector headquarters on Korriban, instituting harsh discipline for their employees. Korriban became a hub of weapon smuggling during this time as well. <\/p><p>The Sith Training Academy was located on the outskirts of Dreshdae, close to the Valley of the Dark Lords. It was a place where Sith were trained in a similar manner as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi<\/a>, with hundreds of students receiving instruction from Sith Masters. However, training was exceedingly dangerous; cheating, subterfuge, and elimination of rivals was not only accepted but highly encouraged. Young students would often travel to Dreshdae during their down time, anxious to start fights with the locals or the bands of mercenaries that frequented the spaceport. <\/p><p>The Valley of the Dark Lords is the most famous place on Korriban. Closely located to the Sith Training Academy and the capital, Dreshdae, the valley is filled with huge, ominous statues and cyclopean tombs, many of which are partially buried in the sand. Known tombs include those of the Sith Lords Tulak Hord, Ludo Kressh, Ajunta Pall, Marka Ragnos, and Naga Sadow. A tomb was even created for Darth Vader, although it was never used and was offered instead to Emperor Palpatine. These tombs are filled with all manner of traps, dangerous beasts, and the spirits of Sith Lords who take tremendous umbrage with tomb raiders. The Valley of the Dark Lords is a Minor <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Site\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dark Side Site\">Dark Side Site<\/a>; however, the actual tombs themselves are Major <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Sites\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dark Side Sites\">Dark Side Sites<\/a>, or in the case of Naga Sadow's tomb, an Extreme <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Site\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dark Side Site\">Dark Side Site<\/a>. <\/p><p>The tombs hold tremendous treasure, as well as temptation and corruption for all who enter. As one of the most sacred sites for <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith<\/a>, the Valley of the Dark Lords is a common destination for Sith seeking knowledge and power. The spirits of the Sith Lords are fickle and demanding, however, and few of these seekers have the willpower and command of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side<\/a> to be deemed worthy for such instruction. More than a few pairing Sith wind up entombed along with the moldering bones of the Sith Lords, their essence feeding <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side<\/a> that permeates the very foundations of the place. <\/p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Korriban_Adventure_Hooks\">Korriban Adventure Hooks<\/span><\/h3><p>Korriban is full of dangerous locations suffused with the insidious power of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side\" title=\"The Dark Side\">The Dark Side<\/a>. Ancient evil and forbidden knowledge can be found throughout the planet, and it's quite possible to set an entire campaign based around the secrets of Korriban. Here are some ways to incorporate Korriban into your campaigns. <\/p><ul>\n <li>During <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Old Republic Era\">The Old Republic Era<\/a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith<\/a> reestablish an academy on Korriban. After a student expedition uncovers a tomb from a previously unknown Sith Lord, members of the Jedi High Council begin receiving strange visions of planets in flame. The heroes are sent by the Jedi Council to infiltrate the academy and join the expedition in hopes of discovering what secrets this new tomb might hold and find a way to prevent its evil from escaping. To succeed, the heroes must also maintain their cover as cruel students of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith<\/a> philosophy.<\/li> \n <li>The Jedi Council authorizes a number of hunting expeditions to Korriban to eliminate the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Terentatek\" title=\"Terentatek\">Terentatek<\/a> from the galaxy. The heroes are part of one such hunting expedition and must traverse through the labyrinth-like catacombs of the Valley of the Dark Lords to find their prey. The massive creatures they are sent to hunt might become the least of their problems.<\/li> \n <li>During an adventure, one of the heroes comes across an unique amulet that once belonged to a Sith Lord interred on Korriban. The amulet begins to whispering to the hero, alternating between maddening words and tempting thoughts- power could be had if the hero goes to Korriban and returns the amulet to its resting spot.<\/li>\n<\/ul>",

Droid heroes are assumed either to be \"self-owned\" or to be owned by another player character (with the approval of both the Gamemaster and the player in question). Even if owned by another member of the party, the Gamemaster should ensure that the owner does not abuse their authority by giving unreasonable or unwanted orders to the other player's Droid character. <\/p><p>A Droid player character should be treated the same as any other player character, and in most cases it is best to give suggestions or advice instead of actual orders.

They are typically fashioned in the likeness of their creators or in a utilitarian design that stresses function. Their usefulness makes them a common sight on nearly every inhabited world in the galaxy. They provide assistance, advice, and sometimes even friendship to trillions of sentient beings on a daily basis. <\/p><h3><span id=\"A_Droid.27s_Life\"><\/span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_Droid's_Life\">A Droid's Life<\/span><\/h3><p>Droids are usually property, bought and sold like any other piece of equipment. Although some Droid owners come to think of their Droids as friends, the fact remains that Droids are programmed to serve whoever is designated as their master. To the vast majority of Droids, the concept of Droid independence is unthinkable. Without someone to command them, what would they do? <\/p><p>Even so, ownership and control are two very different things. Droids must do what they are commanded to do to the best of their ability, but their programming dictates how they accomplish their orders. Ordered to find a replacement part for an X-wing, a Droid might commence a systematic search of the repair bay, then the docking facility, then the neighborhood, then the countryside, and so on- all while thinking its actions are perfectly logical. Droids often need very specific instructions to do what their masters command, in a manner meeting their master's expectations. <\/p><p>Occasionally, events conspire to lead a Droid to independence. These so-called \"self-owned\" Droids are few, but not as rare as many believe. One might hear stories of Droids that escape their masters after years of abuse, or of an entire line of Droids that manifest violent personalities as the result of a programming glitch. However, independent Droids are rarely haywire, rampaging killers. Independent Droids often enter into partnerships organic beings, particularly on worlds where a lone Droid without a master draws a lot of unwanted attention. Independent Droids sometimes even seek each other out, hoping to find strength and security in numbers. Some independent Droids are thrust into the unlikely role of hero, helping to defend the galaxy from the depredations of evil as personified by the likes of the Empire and the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong\" title=\"Yuuzhan Vong\">Yuuzhan Vong<\/a>. <\/p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Droid_Heroes\">Droid Heroes<\/span><\/h2><p><i>Main Article: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid_Heroes\" title=\"Droid Heroes\">Droid Heroes<\/a><\/i> <\/p><p>If you want to play a Droid as a hero, you can either play an existing Droid from this section or create your own unique Droid hero. Droid heroes are assumed either to be \"self-owned\" or to be owned by another player character (with the approval of both the Gamemaster and the player in question). Even if owned by another member of the party, the Gamemaster should ensure that the owner does not abuse their authority by giving unreasonable or unwanted orders to the other player's Droid character. A Droid player character should be treated the same as any other player character, and in most cases it is best to give suggestions or advice instead of actual orders. (In fact, most Droid heroes have a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heuristic_Processor\" title=\"Heuristic Processor\">Heuristic Processor<\/a> so that they can creatively interpret orders and thus justify acting as they wish.) <\/p><p>When you decide to play a Droid hero, you'll have to pack out a few details about what type of Droid your character will be.
