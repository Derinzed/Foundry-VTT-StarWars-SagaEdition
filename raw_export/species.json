href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Planet_Hoppers\" title=\"Planet Hoppers\">Planet Hoppers<\/a>)<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>Skakoans are a technologically advanced Species that specializes in microelectronics, Starship engineering, and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques. <\/p>\n <p>During the time of the Republic, Skakoans were among the most influential Species in the Techno Union, a galaxy-spanning consortium of megacorporations with representation in the Galactic Senate. Despite the misgivings of other high-ranking members of the Techno Union, Skakoan foreman Wat Tambor pledged to support the Separatists under Count Dooku. The Senate responded by expelling their Techno Union representatives. This contributed to the Skakoan homeworld breaking away from the Republic, and joining the Separatist Movement.&nbsp; <\/p>\n <p>The Skakoans were central to the Techno Union's success throughout the Clone Wars. However, the days of the Techno Union were numbered. From the ashes of the Old Republic emerged the Empire and with it, the Emperor's New Order. Gluttonous, self-serving bureaucracies like the Techno Union, the Commerce Guild, and the Trade Federation had outlived their usefulness, and their now-<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> overseers were not to be trusted under the new regime. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans<\/a> forcefully displaced the Techno Union's Skakoan membership. The Skakoan people could do nothing except withdraw to their homeworld and watch helplessly as the Empire dismantled the Techno Union and placed it's constituent companies (Among them Baktoid Armor Workshop, Hoersch-Kessel Driveworks Inc., and Balmorran Arms) under Imperial supervision.&nbsp; <\/p>\n <p>The fall of the Empire and the birth of the New Republic failed to overcome the Skakoans' growing sense of isolation. Their dislike for humanity clouded their infrequent dealings with the New Republic, and they are less inclined to share their technological advances. During the New Jedi Order era, the Skakoans are viewed by most other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> as secretive, manipulative xenophobes best left to their own devices.&nbsp; <\/p>\n <p>The Skakoan homeworld has a unique and highly pressurized atmosphere. For this reason, Skakoans can only survive in standard atmospheres with the aid of a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skakoan_Pressure_Suit\" title=\"Skakoan Pressure Suit\">Skakoan Pressure Suit<\/a>. The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skakoan_Pressure_Suit\" title=\"Skakoan Pressure Suit\">Skakoan Pressure Suit<\/a> completely hides the wearer's face and figure.

All these words and more describe the Nagai people. They first appeared to be galactic invaders, until it was revealed that the Nagai were escaping their long-time enemies, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tofs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tofs\">Tofs<\/a>. Initially hostile to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a>, the Nagai eventually formed an alliance of convenience with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a> in an attempt to achieve victory in their war against the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tofs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tofs\">Tofs<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p>The Nagai are charismatic- a quality that is, by and large, a product of their enhanced vocal range, which allows them to tailor their speech to be more soothing. They are driven by a strong sense of personal honor, which is tempered by their own individualities. The Nagai fear nothing aside from a loss of freedom, symbolized by the return of the enemy that once enslaved their people. They have little concern for individuals outside of their own families, and they only endeavor to aid others if it serves their purposes or if they are bound by honor to do so. <\/p>\n <p>Melee combat, especially the use of edged weapons, is highly integrated into Nagai culture. It is a rare Nagai who does not display an expert's hand in the use of blades of all sizes. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nagai_Characteristics\">Nagai Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Nagai tend to be disciplined, focused, and passionate. They kill without hesitation if honor would be served by the act, and they take great pride in hard-fought victories. They possess a grim wit that, when combined with their soothing voices, can often set enemies off-balance. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Nagai possess straight black hair, dark eyes, porcelain-white skin, and slender builds. No two Nagai dress the same, and they take great pains to express their own individual sense of style. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b> Nagai age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-11 Years <\/td> \n    <td>12-18 Years <\/td> \n    <td>19-44 Years <\/td> \n    <td>45-60 Years <\/td> \n    <td>61-74 Years <\/td> \n    <td>75+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nagi\" title=\"Nagi\">Nagi<\/a>, a world in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a>.

Era Campaign Guide<\/a><\/i> <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Sakiyans rarely venture far from their home system, showing little interest in traveling or trading with the galaxy at large. <\/p>\n <p>During the days of the Old Republic, there was some dispute among xenobiologists as to whether the Sakiyans should be classified as a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Human\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Near-Human\">Near-Human<\/a> Species. The unusual structure of their brain led Imperial xenobiologists to conclude that they were a distinctly alien Species. <\/p>\n <p>The highly evolved Sakiyan brain is nearly twice the size of the average <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> brain. While the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bith\" title=\"Bith\">Bith<\/a> brain remains one of the most advanced among common alien <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, the parts of the Sakiyan brain that process sensory input are superior even to the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bith\" title=\"Bith\">Bith<\/a>. These keen senses helped primitive Sakiyans survive against the fierce predators of their homeworld, but even as the Species developed the intellect to use tools and construct weapons and shelters, they retained their sharp senses. In fact, Sakiyans possess what other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> consider nigh-supernatural perception. <\/p>\n <p>A series of offworld invasions punctuate Sakiyan history, during which the culture survived by maintaining a constant state of vigilance. Evacuation plans are meticulously prepared and constantly revised. Most Sakiyan communities have multiple plans for evacuation in case of invasion and war. Further, every household and government agency relies on lightweight repulsorlift platforms to quickly transport people, resources, and supplies to safe havens. <\/p>\n <p>Once mobile, Sakiyan troops then conduct a constant series of hit-and-run attacks against enemies until their invaders withdraw from the conquered lands. Sakiyan colonies carry with them the tradition of defense and mobility, resisting domination by <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith<\/a>, the forces of the Tion Hegemony, and other oppressors. In recent centuries, they have fallen under the economic control of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hutts\">Hutts<\/a>, but have averted outright enslavement by keeping the \"Slugs\" at arm's length in every place except Saki's major trade centers. <\/p>\n <p>The ties between the Sakiyans and the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hutts\">Hutts<\/a> are primarily forged around repulsorlift technology. Sakiyans quickly adopted and improved repulsorlift technology introduced to them by Old Republic scouts. Over the centuries, they have adapted the technology to their needs, focusing primarily on making the motivators smaller and more efficient. The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hutts\">Hutts<\/a> are particularly fond of Sakiyan repulsorlift technology, as it allows them to construct smaller and more elegant repulsor sleds. <\/p>\n <p>Thanks to its location near the heart of Hutt Space, the Sakiyan homeworld escaped the tyranny of the Empire, although many Sakiyan technicians were forced to relocate to Imperial research installations, where they contributed to the development of a new generation of Imperial repulsortanks. The Saki System also escaped the notice of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong\" title=\"Yuuzhan Vong\">Yuuzhan Vong<\/a> as they pressed into Hutt Space- at least during the first advance. The Sakiyan leadership remains concerned that their traditional method of dealing with alien invasions may not work if the war fleets of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong\" title=\"Yuuzhan Vong\">Yuuzhan Vong<\/a> strike against their home.

Wikia user Lukewarner (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>The Omwati are a willowy humanoid Species from <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim\" title=\"The Outer Rim\">The Outer Rim<\/a> world of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Omwat\" title=\"Omwat\">Omwat<\/a>. They developed their own culture and technology, believing they were the only sentient beings in the galaxy. They unified early in their history under a single world government, thus managing to avoid the devastating wars that plague many worlds on the verge of becoming spacefaring societies. They enjoyed a nearly uninterrupted development of philosophy, arts, medicine, and mathematical theories. Their manufacturing, irrigation, mining, and construction methods are quite advanced, although their overall technology level lags far behind what's considered the galactic standard. Their unique honeycomblike cities are spread across the planet, yet their environment remains almost as clean as that found on unsettled worlds. The Omwati managed to do what few Species have accomplished- a balance between the production needs of a technologically advanced society and sound stewardship of their world's resources. <\/p>\n <p>The first Old Republic ship to visit <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Omwat\" title=\"Omwat\">Omwat<\/a> was a <i><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Victory_I-Class_Star_Destroyer\" title=\"Victory I-Class Star Destroyer\">Victory I<\/a><\/i><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Victory_I-Class_Star_Destroyer\" title=\"Victory I-Class Star Destroyer\">-Class Star Destroyer<\/a> commanded by future Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. Omwati society- after some initial shock- welcomed the visitors. Tarkin and his team left technological, cultural, and historical data behind for the Omwati to study and departed with a promise of other ships to come. Tarkin did not inform the Omwati that their world must have been visited by ancient ships of the early Republic, since their kind did indeed exist elsewhere in the universe- in fact, a small community thrived on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a>.<\/p>\n <p>More than a decade passed before Tarkin would return to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Omwat\" title=\"Omwat\">Omwat<\/a>. Always a forward-looking man, he had decided to keep the native society on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Omwat\" title=\"Omwat\">Omwat<\/a> a secret among himself and his fellow mission commanders, hoping some day that they would be able to profit from a world that could be his personal think tank. When the Emperor gave Tarkin dominion over <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim_Territories\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Outer Rim Territories\">The Outer Rim Territories<\/a>, the Grand Moff felt the time had come to exploit the Omwati. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>While Imperial diplomats kept the people of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Omwat\" title=\"Omwat\">Omwat<\/a> enthralled with tales of galactic society (Never mentioning their cousins elsewhere in the galaxy), Tarkin supervised the construction of an orbital education facility. Once it was complete, the Imperials revealed their true nature. The Omwati would conduct planetwide intelligence and aptitude tests and surrender those children who score the highest, they were told; resistance would result in the destruction of their cities from orbit. The Omwati reluctantly agreed. They surrendered hundreds of Omwati children, never hearing from them again. <\/p>\n <p>When Tarkin and many of his closest associates were killed in the destruction of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Death_Star\" title=\"The Death Star\">The Death Star<\/a>, the orbital facility at <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Omwat\" title=\"Omwat\">Omwat<\/a> was abandoned. In the meantime, the Omwati had been secretly developing craft capable of breaking free from the gravitational pull of their world and managed to reach the satellite. They did not recover the lost children, but they found technology that helped them greatly advance their own fledgling space program. The Omwati developed their first hyperdrive-capable vessel roughly ten years after the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a>. This development was spurred by the desire to find the children who had become lost among the stars. The Omwati did not want to believe the satellite's data that implied all but ten were dead. <\/p>\n <p>Omwati explorers were eventually contacted by New Republic diplomats- but only after these Omwati terrorized a number of small <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Outer Rim\">Outer Rim<\/a> colonies and refueling posts- and another of the Empire's atrocities became fully documented. The offworld Omwati welcomed their \"Primitive\" cousins with open arms. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Omwati_Characteristics\">Omwati Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Omwati are gracious, intelligent, and wise.

with the diversity of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> in the galaxy, the Givin often manage to shock or at least cause unease in most humanoids, since they greatly resemble walking skeletons. However, Givin are universally sought after as starship builders and engineers, both for their mathematically inclined minds and for their unique physiology that allows them to survive in complete vacuum. <\/p>\n <p>Mathematics permeates every aspect of Givin society, so much so that even their language is infused with such concepts. Givin children start training early, preparing their minds to handle incredibly complex equations. Rigorous competitions determine the best and the brightest students, who are sent to monasteries where they spend their lives in deep contemplation, attempting to unravel the mysteries of life through formulae and mathematics.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The shipyards that circle <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yag%27Duhl\" title=\"Yag'Duhl\">Yag'Duhl<\/a>, the Givin homeworld, produce sturdy and elegant starships and compete on a level matched only by the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Duros\" title=\"Duros\">Duros<\/a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Verpine\" title=\"Verpine\">Verpine<\/a>, the only <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> that receive grudging respect from the Givin. However, Givin designers do not equip their ships with Navicomputers, since most Givin can calculate hyperspace jumps in their heads, and they often overlook life-support systems. Members of other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> that purchase Givin built ships must add these components. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Givin_Characteristics\">Givin Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Givin are so analytical and logical that they think and converse in mathematical terminology. They typically keep to themselves, leading other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> to consider them withdrawn and somber. Givin approach most events with only vague interest. However, when presented with a mathematical puzzle, they become animated and verbose, especially with anyone that can keep up with their explanations. Givin informally refer to members of other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> as \"Soft\" and regard most of them with a mix of pity and contempt because of their inability to survive in a vacuum unaided. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Givin are gaunt and skeletal, with exteriors covered in sealed carapaces. These exoskeletons act as organic vacuum suits, allowing the Givin to survive in a complete lack of atmosphere and making them immune to the effects of inhalants.

Some speculate that the Ryn were a race of warriors, dispatched to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Core_Worlds\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Core Worlds\">Core Worlds<\/a> ages ago to contend with some threat, while others suggest that the Ryn were a tribe of ten thousand musicians gifted to a world that had no artists of their own. Either could be true, for the Ryn are as fearless in battle as they are skilled in music. <\/p>\n <p>For all their talents, Ryn find the galaxy largely inhospitable. They have a reputation for being untrustworthy and treacherous, dangerous to befriend and fickle in their loyalties. Although that is true of many Ryn, most are just free spirits looking to survive. They are among the hardest working people known. <\/p>\n <p>The Ryn are natural entertainers. Between jobs, they supplement their incomes through fortune-telling using Sabacc cards (A game they are believed to have invented), singing, dancing, and any other musical arts (See <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sabacc_Fortune-Telling\" title=\"Sabacc Fortune-Telling\">Sabacc Fortune-Telling<\/a>). <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ryn_Characteristics\">Ryn Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Wanderlust consumes the Ryn. They cannot abide confinement and constraint, and they itch to move on shortly after they arrive in a new place. Ryn are fun loving and flamboyant, but centuries of cruelty, oppression, and exploitation have taken their toll. This has led some Ryn to become more insular and secretive, which of course, does nothing to diminish the suspicion and distrust others have for the Ryn. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Ryn are humanoid, but slightly shorter than <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans<\/a>. All Ryn have thick, muscular tails that end in white tufts. Prehensile, their tails can support their weight and even act as a third arm. A fine coat of smoke-gray fur covers their bodies, while they grow thick white to blue-white hair on their heads. Males wear thin moustaches and beards. A Ryn's most distinctive feature is its nose. A chitinous organ, similar to a beak, it is perforated to allow the passage of air. Ryn can pipe sounds through these holes to create a variety of tones, whistles, and pops. Skilled Ryn can use these \"Beaks\" to create music. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b> Ryn age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-10 Years <\/td> \n    <td>11-20 Years <\/td> \n    <td>21-40 Years <\/td> \n    <td>41-60 Years <\/td> \n    <td>61-80 Years <\/td> \n    <td>81+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> The Ryn are believed to have come from somewhere among the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Core_Worlds\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Core Worlds\">Core Worlds<\/a>, but they have traveled for so long that even the Ryn no longer remember from where they hail. <\/p>\n <p><b>Languages:<\/b> Ryn all speak Basic and Ryn, and they are quick studies, learning languages from all over the galaxy. <\/p>\n <p><b>Example Names:<\/b> Camarata, Cisgat, Clarani, Droma, Ferfer, Gaph, Lenya, Melisma, Mezza, Romany, R'vanna, Sapha. <\/p>\n <p><b>Adventurers:<\/b> Ryn are born to adventure and are happiest when traveling and exploring.

When they must travel the galaxy, they usually do so in groups of at least three, a holdover from a time when their society was heavily dominated by a caste structure. Solitary Sarkans are usually outcasts who have committed a grave offense on their homeworld. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Sarkan technology is equal to the galactic norm, but the Species never developed its own space travel. Outsiders found Sarkans difficult to interact with on a business or diplomatic level, as their intricate culture focuses on rigid, arcane codes of conduct that visiting aliens are expected to know. Those who violate Sarkan codes of conduct are dismissed as barbarians and removed from the presence of high-ranking Sarkans by efficient bodyguards. ln addition to using their thick tails for added balance and stability, Sarkans trained in native martial arts traditions learn to use them as weapons. <\/p>\n <p> During the reign of the Empire, the Sarkans begrudgingly allowed <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans<\/a> and representatives from companies that were known to have the Emperor's favor to insult them by not adhering to the proper rituals.

<p>The Eirrauc are a primitive Species of migratory omnivores. They travel in groups around their mild world developing their arts, specifically music and drama. They have mobile hydroponic gardens and gifted artisans.&nbsp; When two migratory communities met, they often engage in trade and sometimes arranged marriages to keep their gene pool varied. The Eirraucs practice a pure democracy, where every member of the community had a full vote on every issue facing the migratory band. If an Eirrauc feels strongly opposed to a particular decision, they are free to join another community at their leisure. This often occurs when two communities crossed paths.&nbsp; <\/p>\n <p>When <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire\" title=\"The Galactic Empire\">The Galactic Empire<\/a> took control of the galaxy, the hardworking Eirraucs were enslaved.

The snouted heads sit atop a long, slender neck, and they have a pair of eyes on either side of their snout. They tend to stand at two meters when in a comfortable position, though when standing at their full height they are closer to 2.4 meters.

Wikia user Lukewarner (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>The Tarasin are a tribal Species of omnivorous reptilian humanoids native to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cularin\" title=\"Cularin\">Cularin<\/a>, a predominately tropical world. They inhabit the planet's sprawling jungles and rainforests. <\/p>\n <p>Although the Tarasin enjoyed peaceful first contact with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> explorers during the time of the Old Republic, their dealings with offworlders soured when trading companies began plundering Cularin's natural resources, uprooting entire forests. The Tarasin, sensitive to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a>, believed in living harmoniously with the land, rather than exploiting it's bounty as the newcomers did. They fought back with surprising ferocity. A treaty helped avert further bloodshed. A friendship, strained at first, grew as the Tarasin and the outsiders got to know each other and started to pursue their own agendas. <\/p>\n <p>As more alien <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> arrived on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cularin\" title=\"Cularin\">Cularin<\/a>, the Tarasin worried more about the future of their home. The offworlders built their cities on platforms that rose above the forest canopies, preserving the natural environment while giving the visitors a place to call home. However, the Tarasin denied certain companies access to the planet's resources and were particularly protective of the ch'hala trees that were sacred to their religion. Words escalated into violence. The trading companies decided to send armed troops down with their workers and Droids to avoid losing valuable equipment. Tarasin reprisals were swift and deadly. The Tarasin tribes demonstrated that they could use the technology of their alien adversaries, and their natural abilities with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a> made them devastating in combat.<\/p>\n <p><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi<\/a> refused to intervene in the Tarasin Revolt. The Trade Federation, holding major interests on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cularin\" title=\"Cularin\">Cularin<\/a>, sent War Droids to secure their operations and protect their crews. The Droids interpreted their orders loosely and decimated the nearby Tarasin tribes in a brutal raid. This outrage prompted a series of bloody counterattacks. Ultimately, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Order\">The Jedi Order<\/a> felt compelled to intervene and sent two Jedi Consulars to negotiate a new treaty. The Tarasin refused to give in to outsider demands, and after six months of tense negotiations, all sides agreed to an accord called the Cularin Compact, sharply curtailing the outsiders' ability to harm the planet. For their part, the Tarasin struggled to work with offworlders, allowing them to harvest limited resources while protecting the planet's ecological balance. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Later years saw many conflicts among the various trading companies and cartels for control of Cularin's resources, but few of these conflicts involved or affected the Tarasin directly. <\/p>\n <p>During <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Rebellion Era\">The Rebellion Era<\/a>, the Empire seized control of all mining operations on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cularin\" title=\"Cularin\">Cularin<\/a>, but the Imperials did nothing to invite conflict with the Tarasin. The planet had little to offer, and the Imperials regarded the Tarasin as a primitive, backwater Species with little potential. The Tarasin hid their mastery of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a>, and unsubstantiated rumors persisted that at least a handful of Jedi took refuge among the Tarasin after escaping the Jedi Purge. <\/p>\n <p>The fall of the Empire spelled the return of the trading cartels, but <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a> was quick to reinstate the Cularin Compact, ensuring that these companies would not despoil the planet. The Tarasin enjoyed their diplomatic dealings with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a>, and a few Force-sensitive Tarasin even expressed interest in joining the New Jedi Order to help repel <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Yuuzhan_Vong_Empire\" title=\"The Yuuzhan Vong Empire\">The Yuuzhan Vong Empire<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p>Most Tarasin dwell in tribal villages. Their tribes, called Irstats, are small (Between thirty and fifty members each) and led by a chieftain (Called the Irstat-Kes), usually the second oldest female in the tribe. They refer to the eldest female in the Irstat simply as \"Mother,\" holding her up as a model of perfection. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tarasin_Characteristics\">Tarasin Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Tarasin are calm, communal, and curious.

When the Republic first visited <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Elom_(Planet)\" title=\"Elom (Planet)\">Elom<\/a> a century before the rise of the Empire, the Elomin were divided into separate political nations, used internal combustion engines and slug-throwing weaponry, and were barely able to launch satellites into orbit. Blasters, repulsorlifts, and Starships were beyond anything the Elomin had ever imagined. They took quickly to the advanced technology the first-contact specialists chose to share with them. By the time the Galactic Civil War erupted, the Elomin and their world were active participants in the galactic economy. <\/p>\n <p>The world of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Elom_(Planet)\" title=\"Elom (Planet)\">Elom<\/a> is rich in deposits of lommite, a mineral used in the fabrication of transparisteel. Lommite became a sought-after commodity, and the Elomin were canny enough to enter into mining agreements with offworld shipbuilders that would not damage the environment of their world.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Culturally, the Elomin try to discover or create order in all things. They view the universe as a logical, organized puzzle, and endeavor to find the pieces and bring them to their logical places. When confronted with something that doesn't fit into the pattern they have defined, they may try to redefine the pattern, but are just as likely to attempt to ignore the discordant details. Such was the case when the Elomin first discovered the existence of the underground-dwelling <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eloms\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eloms\">Eloms<\/a>, another sentient <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> native to their world.

It wasn't until the Republic granted the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eloms\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eloms\">Eloms<\/a> all the rights of sentients under its laws, and the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eloms\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eloms\">Eloms<\/a> helped the Elomin resist Imperial oppression during <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Rebellion Era\">The Rebellion Era<\/a> that the Elomin fully acknowledged the existence and independence of their neighbors. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Elomin_Characteristics\">Elomin Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Elomin have difficulties relating to other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, which they view as perpetrators of chaos.

(Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>Highly intelligent, hermaphroditic insectoids, the Vratix are the creators of the healing substance known as bacta. The Vratix have used bacta for thousands of years, and since the solution includes chemical fluids exuded by the Vratix themselves, they have never been afraid to share the secrets of bacta production with the rest of the galaxy. A healthy business evolved during the time of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic\" title=\"The Galactic Republic\">The Galactic Republic<\/a> once the galaxy at large realized the healing potential of the miracle substance<b>.<\/b><\/p>\n <p>The Vratix share their homeworld with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Humans<\/a> who used cartels to control bacta production. Emperor Palpatine chose two cartels, the Zaltin and Xucphra factions, to supply the Empire's bacta, effectively eliminating all competition in the bacta market. Competition between the cartels was harsh, and the Vratix, who were often caught in the middle, fought for reform. Some Vratix resorted to terrorism and sabotage to achieve their agenda, fighting with ruthless desperation and no remorse. With the help of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rogue_Squadron\" title=\"Rogue Squadron\">Rogue Squadron<\/a>, the Vratix eventually liberated their homeworld from the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> cartels and petitioned <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a> for admission as a member race.

The custom of referring to themselves in the plural, and by their hive name, stems from the Species' hivelike intelligence; for example, a Vratix might say: \"We are pleased to meet you.

Two triple-jointed arms extend from the shoulders, ending in long, three-fingered hands. Vratix stand upright on four legs. The rearmost pair are well muscled and used for jumping. Their triangular heads sport two floppy antennae. Small, thin hairs cover a Vratix's body and exude a chemical that changes the color of the skin as an expression of emotion. Vratix average 1.8 to 2.3 meters tall.

created by Wikia user Lukewarner (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>Tireless laborers and talented artisans, Ugnaughts hail from the distant Anoat System, where they have a prespaceflight culture based around clans devoted to specific crafts and professions.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Ugnaughts have spread throughout much of the galaxy because they have been subjected to the scourge of slavery, often visited upon Species that have not developed interstellar travel. Entire city-states were captured en masse by raiders, and transported to other worlds to work as slaves. Even when the Old Republic outlawed the practice, it continued, with Ugnaught communities \"Immigrating,\" and paying off the cost by working as \"Indentured Servants.\" Due to their hardiness, Ugnaughts were particularly sought-after by operators of mining operations, and they enjoy a well-deserved reputation as expert miners who can extract ore and gases from even the most impossible locations. <\/p>\n <p>While many Ugnaughts in the galaxy are the descendants of slaves, a number of them are members of tribes who left their homeworld as legitimate immigrants, such as the tens of thousands of Ugnaughts in the Cloud City of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bespin\" title=\"Bespin\">Bespin<\/a>, working as laborers and mining <a class=\"new\" title=\"Tibanna Gas (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVGliYW5uYV9HYXM/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Tibanna Gas<\/a>. Without the Irden, Botrut, and Isced clans, Cloud City would never have been built- something in which the Ugnaughts who dwell there take great pride. <\/p>\n <p>Each Ugnaught family has a specific trade or craft to which it is devoted, and all children are expected to learn it. When an Ugnaught reaches <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Adulthood\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Adulthood\">Adulthood<\/a> (At 20 years of age), he or she must take their place among the ranks of other professionals. If the number of new Ugnaughts for profession exceeds the perceived need, the young beings must fight each other in a series of duels-to-the-death for the right to take on the job. Despite this somewhat barbaric tradition, the Ugnaughts are a peaceful Species, who otherwise try to avoid violent conflict. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ugnaught_Characteristics\">Ugnaught Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Ugnaughts are stalwart, meticulous, clever, and unassuming.

The Gree, before, during, and after their enslavement, created countless advanced wonders of technology anywhere from instant teleportation to different worlds or being able to transform a planet to whatever they wished. While they would eventually stagnate and lose much of their technological gifts and knowledge of their ancestors with the decline of their civilization and Species near the end of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rise_of_the_Empire_Era\" title=\"The Rise of the Empire Era\">The Rise of the Empire Era<\/a>, the Gree would still be a talented Species capable of great technological and engineering feats when compared to most of the galaxy. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Formerly, Gree society has four roughly equal castes. Crafters produce devices and Researchers create new technologies. Operators know how to \"Play\" the devices and Administrators function as the Gree government. Each caste has several subgroups or Guilds responsible for individual functions within the caste. As their technology reached its apex, the Operator Caste came to dominate the other castes and eventually eclipsed them. Now the Researcher and Crafter Castes are no longer produced in the spawning beds- partially because they are no longer needed in the dying Gree civilization, and partly because it is believed the Gree have forgotten the proper bioengineering processes to create those castes. The Administration Caste still governs, but tends to give way to the whims of the Operators.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Today, the Gree are an apathetic Species and their once unimaginably grand civilization has declined to near-ruin. They are mostly concerned with maintaining what few technological wonders they still understand, and keeping their culture identity pure and their technology safe from the outside galaxy. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gree_Characteristics\">Gree Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> The Gree are a cold, xenophobic, closed off Species that focused on their pursuits of technological advancement, the growth of knowledge, and their success within their own species.

They have massive heads to contain their very large brain sacs, two large eyes, and a mouth made of multiple fleshy folds beneath their eyes.

Hieroglyphic tattoos on their foreheads denote their caste and rank.

They are protective of their territory- especially their ancient burial grounds. Kaleesh hold their families and tribes in high esteem, and do anything to protect them. These sentiments sometimes extend to non-Kaleesh who prove themselves to be trustworthy companions, but such a distinction is rare. Honor and sacrifice at the expense of oneself are highly valued qualities in their society. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> The Kaleesh are tall, reptilian humanoids. Their scaly skin varies from from deep red to dull yellow. Their black hair is worn in long braids, or tied up in a queue or topknot. The long faces of the Kaleesh are framed on either side by two sharp tusks that extend outward from their jawbones, and their nostrils are two long slits that stretch toward their yellow eyes. However, few non-Kaleesh have seen the faces of these enigmatic aliens, for they wear masks made from the skulls of some of Kalee's most vicious predators. The Kaleesh are also distinguished by their hands, which each feature four long fingers, two of which are fully opposable. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b> Kaleesh age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-9 Years <\/td> \n    <td>10-24 Years <\/td> \n    <td>25-40 Years <\/td> \n    <td>41-55 Years <\/td> \n    <td>56-79 Years <\/td> \n    <td>80+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> The craggy world of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kalee\" title=\"Kalee\">Kalee<\/a>, located in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Space\" title=\"Wild Space\">Wild Space<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p><b>Languages:<\/b> The Kaleesh speak their own sophisticated language of Kaleesh, and after the <a class=\"new\" title=\"Huk (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvSHVrP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Huk<\/a> invasion, most also learn Basic. <\/p>\n <p><b>Example Names:<\/b> Qymaen jai Sheelal, Ronderu lij Kummar, Bentilais san Sk'ar. <\/p>\n <p><b>Adventurers:<\/b> The Kaleesh excel in the roles of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout\" title=\"Scout\">Scout<\/a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier\" title=\"Soldier\">Soldier<\/a>.

Wikia user Darthauthor.<\/i> <\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Dowutins are a long-lived Species of muscle-bound humanoids. So extensive are their lifespans. in fact. it is said that no Dowutin has ever died of old age, instead failing in battle or succumbing to the many perils of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dowut\" title=\"Dowut\">Dowut<\/a>. Whether this is true or a myth perpetuated by Dowutin boasting is difficult to say. It is certain, however, that Dowutins are among the strongest and toughest sentients in the galaxy. For these reasons, they are highly sought as soldiers, mercenaries, and bodyguards. However, Dowutin arrogance is often just as immense, and few condescend to serve what they perceive as weaker beings. <\/p>\n <p>Dowutins prize physical strength and vigor, but in a very different way than most sentient species. For a Dowutin. strength and even combat training are not matters of pride, but matters of pragmatism; on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dowut\" title=\"Dowut\">Dowut<\/a>, those with strength and skill get the resources and respect they are due. Many Dowutins who leave their homeworld are surprised and confused by the criteria the rest of the galaxy uses to assign authority, political power, and leadership positions. More than one Dovvutin has had difficulty adapting and found themselves in deep trouble for it. <\/p>\n <p>Most Dowutins are solitary by choice, although this does not stop a Dowutin from joining forces with others when expedient. Rare, however, are Dowutins who stoop to taking orders from beings smaller or weaker than themselves. Many sentients who find themselves working with Dowutins learn to frame directives as suggestions or even questions, even when they are technically or practically in a position to issue orders or guidance. In some cases, others find it necessary to leave Dowutins under the impression they are in charge, if for no other reason than to keep operations running smoothly. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dowutin_Characteristics\">Dowutin Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Dowutins have a reputation for being unfriendly, even irritable. Although deserved, this too stems from the Species' unusual perspective. Dowutins are as direct in their speech as in any other undertaking, and most have no qualms against speaking the truth as they see it, no matter how harsh it might be. A typical Dowutin simply does not see the point in mincing words. Obfuscation and deception, even to avoid giving offense, complicate matters and cause problems. Many who interact with Dowutins also assume the Species incapable of humor. Although this is not strictly true. Dowutins rarely suffer fools. The sorts of misunderstandings, mishaps, ironies, and even quips that others might find amusing, a typical Dowutin sees only as annoying. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Dowutins are large, aggressive-looking humanoids with chin horns, sharp claws, and thick skin commonly brown in color.

<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Tof_Kingdom\" title=\"The Tof Kingdom\">The Tof Kingdom<\/a><\/i> <\/p>\n <p>The Tofs come from the darkest and most obscure portion of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a>: the peripheral halo.

Violently opposed to streamlined functionality, the Tofs have instead embraced elaborate dress and foppish ritual. Their interstellar vessels resemble traditional sailing ships and sport curved hulls and energy- radiating sails. Their royals wear tailored greatcoats and powdered wigs. Their soldiers carry cutlasses and cudgels and collect battle scars. <\/p>\n <p>Attire becomes more ornate as Tofs climb the military hierarchies that make up their society. Low-ranking deckhands wear simple cloth shirts, leather vests, and head-scarves. Ship's captains are outfitted with heavy buccaneer's boots, sparkling rings on nearly every finger, and a waist sash that holds a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Blaster_Pistol\" title=\"Blaster Pistol\">Blaster Pistol<\/a> and a carved <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Club\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Club\">Club<\/a>. Tofs do not bathe, covering their stink with perfumed bows on their tunics and boots. <\/p>\n <p>Males dominate Tof society. Females are seldom seen and generally kept on-planet where they are visited only when Tof vessels return to port. During long star voyages, Tof males exhibit reckless lust for humanoid females and often make unwanted moves on attractive targets (Or prove vulnerable to feminine flattery). <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tof_Characteristics\">Tof Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> A Tof's temperament is crude. Tofs enjoy rough humor and take pleasure in food and drink. They are hopelessly immersed in their own culture and see no need to understand the ways of other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. After capturing a planet, they topple its monuments and erect grotesque statuary of their own design, including fanciful depictions of water nymphs and horn-playing dryads. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Tofs are largely <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> in appearance, although their skin bears a sickly green sheen and they tend to have massive physiques. Most Tofs can grow to heights of 2.5 meters, and they are either powerfully overmuscled or grossly rotund. Tofs move one slow step at a time and can flatten an opponent with one slap of a slab-sized palm. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Tofs age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-11 Years <\/td> \n    <td>12-16 Years <\/td> \n    <td>17-74 Years <\/td> \n    <td>75-99 Years <\/td> \n    <td>100-114 Years <\/td> \n    <td>115+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> In the distant past, the Tofs build a seagoing society on the waterworld also known as <a class=\"new\" title=\"Tof (Planet) (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVG9mXyhQbGFuZXQpP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Tof<\/a>. This high point in their history is known for fantastic ship-to-ship battles, narrow escapes from titanic ocean predators, and drinking and carousing in the low ports constructed on the planet's island chains. <\/p>\n <p><b>Languages:<\/b> Tofs exclusively speak Tof, believing other languages to be beneath them. They may learn to understand other languages, but they feel it an insult to speak such a thing aloud. <\/p>\n <p><b>Example Names:<\/b> Bargthron, Sereno, Supreme. <\/p>\n <p><b>Adventurers:<\/b>&nbsp;Quick to laugh and often grinning from ear to ear, Tofs can be mistaken as boisterous and good- natured revelers. The facade is revealed when Tof smiles turn cruel and their interest turns toward vandalism and torture. <\/p>\n <p>The Tofs are single-minded in their pursuit of pleasure. They come from a plentiful world where they enjoy many luxuries, and they seldom know hunger or hardship. In many ways, these characteristics make them more monstrous than the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vagaari\" title=\"Vagaari\">Vagaari<\/a> or the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Killik\" title=\"Killik\">Killiks<\/a>, which at least believe that they must expand their territory or die.

In their native tongue, \"S'kytri\" means \"The Windborn.\" <\/p>\n <p>The enlightened beliefs of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi<\/a> appealed to Klarymere, the S'kytri Patriarch. His unswerving loyalty to the Jedi during the Clone Wars condemned the S'kytri to Imperial slavery following the Jedi Purge. The Empire conquered their world, and the S'kytri spent long years in unwilling servitude to Majestrix Kharys, a sadistic S'kytri chosen by Darth Vader to enforce Imperial doctrine.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The fall of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire\" title=\"The Galactic Empire\">The Galactic Empire<\/a> brought the restoration of S'kytri independence and the return of the patriarchy. Years of economic hardship spawned a growing counterculture of rebellious and wayward young S'kytri, despite clan elders espousing a return to tradition. Since the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a> and the formation of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a>, the S'kytri leaders have politely refused all overtures by offworlders to join the greater galactic community. <\/p>\n <p>S'kytri seem more interested in protecting and nurturing their homeworld by treating it as a living, breathing entity. They are also afraid of losing their culture. Most S'kytri have little use for technology, although contact with the rest of the galaxy has prompted some S'kytri to reluctantly adopt technology designed to ease the quality of life. <\/p>\n <p>Although a mammalian <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, S'kytri hatch from eggs. Clothing is unimportant to S'kytri, for too much material creates unwanted wind resistance during flight.

Young adult S'kytri tend to be especially arrogant, defiant, and rebellious. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> S'kytri have thin, muscular physiques and attractive, chiseled features. Feathered wings grow from their shoulder blades. Although physically strong, S'kytri have hollow bones and are much lighter than they seem at a glance. Adults average 2 to 2.2 meters tall, and S'kytri under 1.8 meters tall are considered \"Short\" by the species' standard. Male S'kytri typically have pale blue skin, while females usually have light green skin. Less than one percent of the population is born with reversed pigmentation; the S'kytri treat these hatchlings as abominations of nature and destroy them.

Iktotchi are famed for their prowess as pilots, and attribute their success at the helm to nearly imperceptible precognitive inclinations. <\/p>\n <p>Because of their visions, Iktotchi are aware of the bloodshed that heralds the coming of the Clone Wars. Many of the era's prominent diplomats are Iktotchi who seek to avert the impending violence. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Iktotchi_Characteristics\">Iktotchi Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Iktotchi are a deeply emotional <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>.

Intrigue<\/a><\/i> <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Almost completely unknown by the rest of the galaxy, Fosh are an avianlike Species that hail from an unknown planet. Outwardly quiet, reserved, and thoughtful, in truth Fosh are contemptuous of other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> and consider all non-Fosh to be inferior. Fosh keep this condescension and bigotry to themselves, however. They are remarkably manipulative and are masters of intrigue, deal making, and deception. Only <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bothans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bothans\">Bothans<\/a> are more skilled at pulling the strings of others. Because the Fosh are close-mouthed and few in number, even the name and location of their homeworld is shrouded in mystery. <\/p>\n <p>Fosh are short and slender with hollow bones. Their faces end in sharp beaks with openings that turn up at the back to give Fosh permanent, sardonic smiles. Their arms end in delicate hands that each have four taloned fingers. Their sturdy legs end in twin splayed talons that allow them to perch on incredibly narrow spaces, such as pipes or large branches. Soft whiskers radiate from the front ridges of their heads, much as hair does on a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a>, along with two antennae, which do not seem to serve any purpose- at least, not one that scholars can identify. Feathers on a Fosh's head turn different colors, depending on the Fosh's mood. Because of their delicate nature and fragile makeup, most Fosh stay away from violence and rely on their manipulation skills to defuse difficult situations. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fosh_Characteristics\">Fosh Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Fosh are quiet and private. They speak obliquely with other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, sowing confusion with cryptic phrases and riddles. Fosh rarely confess their true motivations for anything and focus on the long term, setting up elaborate plans and schemes to realize their interests. Most Fosh look down on other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, a fact they keep to themselves. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Fosh are short, slender, and graceful birdlike humanoids. Their heads are capped with two antennae and a plumage of feathers that change color based on each Fosh's mood. Their faces end in short beaks, and their eyes, which have a gemlike quality, are commonly colored ruby red, bright citrine, or deep azure. Special glands connected to their tear ducts allow Fosh to release a unique chemical that can be used to create powerful medicine. Using this ability takes a toll on a Fosh, who must rest to regain strength afterward. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Fosh age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-11 Years <\/td> \n    <td>12-17 Years <\/td> \n    <td>18-55 Years <\/td> \n    <td>56-70 Years <\/td> \n    <td>71-84 Years <\/td> \n    <td>85+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> Unknown.

Nearly a century before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, the Tarro homeworld was destroyed when its sun exploded with little warning. Tarro survivors living in other systems speculated that a Tarro-built superweapon may have caused the catastrophe, although the truth might never be known. <\/p>\n <p>Only a few hundred Tarro survived the destruction of their home system, and they quickly scattered among the stars.

Some Tarro have purportedly learned to overcome their \"Loner\" attitude. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Humanoid, with a large forehead, a thick brow, flat nose, and a broad mouth filled with sharp teeth, the average Tarro stands about 2 meters tllt.

However, their sharp minds and keen wit often make those who deal with Toydarians feel like they have been taken advantage of. Most Toydarians have some degree of business savvy, and many have a penchant for gambling (Even to their own detriment). <\/p>\n <p>Toydarians are capable of flight from birth, and can hover in place. Toydarians prefer to fly at all times, though the speed with which their wings beat consumes large amounts of energy. As a result, Toydarians consume several times more food than <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans<\/a> do in a single day, and some of the bloodiest wars in Toydarian history have been fought over food supplies.

have been driven into virtual extinction by natural disaster and their own violent tendencies. Spiners evolved on a world hidden deep within the stellar cloud drifts of the Elrood Sector. Their homeworld exploded when its star went supernova roughly 200 years before the rise of the Empire. Republic scientists discovered the imminent disaster in progress but could not rescue more than a few thousand individuals. These Spiners were quickly absorbed into galactic society. Little of their own culture survived. Since their traditions were mostly incompatible with the alien societies they settled near or within, and Spiner technology (With the exception of certain geothermal energy management techniques) had been well below galactic standard. <\/p>\n <p>It is widely believed that the surviving population of Spiners is too small for the Species to avoid extinction. The future of the Species is further endangered by the little-known fact that a genetic flaw prevents Spiners from reproducing anywhere other than in the Elrood Sector. However, interested historians have pointed out that some \"Lost\" Spiner colonies may exist within the Elrood Sector.

Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i><\/p>\n <p>Nuknog are diminutive humanoids with small brains and short tempers. Nearly 1,000 years before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, Nuknog leaders \"Sold\" their homeworld to a consortium of unscrupulous mining corporations in exchange for jobs, food, and modest accommodations. <\/p>\n <p> The Nuknog worked in mines and processing factories, performing tasks deemed too dangerous for offworld personnel. They received no money for their work, ate leftovers, and slept in tight, prefabricated military barracks. Shoddy equipment and mining accidents claimed countless Nuknog lives, and all that time the Nuknog had no sense that the corporations were exploiting and mistreating them. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Nuknog remained the unknowing slaves of one corporation or another for centuries as mining contracts changed hands. It wasn't until a pair of Jedi came to the planet in search of a wanted criminal that the mistreatment of the Nuknog caught the attention of the greater galactic community. The Republic Senate ordered the mining corporations to terminate all operations on the Nuknog homeworld and repay several centuries' worth of lost wages. The corporations dissolved amid the controversy, leaving the Nuknog with empty mines, empty factories, and empty stomachs. Sympathy for the Nuknog ran high. Republic relief workers delivered emergency food supplies to the starving Nuknog and offered to help rebuild the planet's devastated agricultural industry. Thinking that the Republic, like the mining corporations might be manipulating them in some fashion, the Nuknog took the free food but blamed the Republic for depriving them of the only life they knew. Their leaders demanded that the Republic provide the Nuknog with food and supplies in perpetuity. When it became clear that the Nuknog were unwilling to help themselves, all sympathy for the Species evaporated. <\/p>\n <p>With the rise of the Separatists and the events leading up to the Clone Wars, the Republic faced political turmoil on many fronts. The plight of the Nuknog no longer captured the interest of the Senate or the galaxy at large. The Nuknog now had another reason to resent the Republic. <\/p>\n <p>The Nuknog change very little after the Clone Wars and the fall of the Republic. The average life expectancy of a Nuknog is nearly doubled if it makes its home offworld- a luxury few Nuknog can afford. That said, a few Nuknog have successfully bought passage on passing ships, usually by selling themselves into slavery <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nuknog_Characteristics\">Nuknog Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b>&nbsp;Nuknog are short-tempered, petty, easily manipulated beings who rarely see the big picture.

Species, the Barabel are relative newcomers to the galactic community. Having evolved from nocturnal predators, Barabels are well-suited to cope with prolonged period of darkness, and they retain much of their ancestor's ferocity. <\/p>\n <p>Several centuries prior to the formation of the Empire- at least according to Barabel legend- an <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ithorian\" title=\"Ithorian\">Ithorian<\/a> Jedi explorer named Noga-ta came to their world and peacefully settled a millennium-long civil war stemming from a dispute over prime hunting grounds. This instills a high regard for the Jedi in all Barabel for centuries to follow, even in the wake of the Galactic Empire's anti-Jedi propaganda. For a short time, the Barabels are hunted by illegal safaris set up by Imperial-backed Planetary Safaris, but a massed uprising by the Barabels compels the Empire to intervene and put a stop to the hunts. <\/p>\n <p>Offworld, Barabels take up professions that make use of their predatory nature, the most common being bounty hunting. Surprisingly, Barabels willingly follow orders once a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chain_of_Command\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chain of Command\">Chain of Command<\/a> is clearly established, making them prized members of mercenary units.

Females lacked the chin spurs, but they instead had smaller protrusions on their forehead. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Zygerrians age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-9 Years <\/td> \n    <td>10-16 Years <\/td> \n    <td>17-39 Years <\/td> \n    <td>40-60 Years <\/td> \n    <td>61-80 Years <\/td> \n    <td>81+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> The flat and barren world of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Zygerria\" title=\"Zygerria\">Zygerria<\/a>, located in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim\" title=\"The Outer Rim\">The Outer Rim<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p><b>Languages:<\/b> Whatever native tongue the Zygerrians once had has been lost to the ebbs of time, with Basic becoming the Zygerrians' primary language. <\/p>\n <p><b>Example Names:<\/b> Agruss, Darts D'Nar, Atai Molec, Miraj Scintel, Atlee Thanda, Marko Tyne, Zolghast. <\/p>\n <p><b>Adventurers:<\/b> Zygerrian adventurers make excellent <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier\" title=\"Soldier\">Soldiers<\/a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout\" title=\"Scout\">Scouts<\/a>, because their people have been nomadic pirates and slavers in the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Outer Rim\">Outer Rim<\/a> for centuries.

href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_of_Intrigue\" title=\"Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy of Intrigue\">Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy of Intrigue<\/a><\/i> <\/p>\n <p>The Umbarans hail from a hard-to-reach world deep within The Outer Rim's Ghost Nebula. Although they have been part of galactic civilization for millennia, very few Umbarans have left their home system, and even fewer have risen to positions of power and fame in the galaxy. Umbarans are interested in alien cultures and civilizations, but they prefer to observe from a distance rather than take an active role in events. <\/p>\n <p>During the rise of the Empire, the Umbarans spend a few decades moving through the halls of supreme political power. An Umbaran named Sly Moore serves as Palpatine's chief aide during his later years as Chancellor of the Republic and the earliest period of his reign as Emperor. Moore's prominence in galactic politics causes her to be so admired on her homeworld that she inspires other Umbarans to venture out into the rest of the galaxy. Many of them join Moore on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a>, and soon Umbarans are a common sight on that world.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>As Palpatine's New Order becomes increasingly biased toward <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans<\/a>, Moore vanishes from the Emperor's side and moves into more shadowy roles within his government. From deep within the intelligence apparatus, she and other Umbarans lead efforts to root out anyone who is not unquestionably loyal to Emperor Palpatine, and they answer only to the Emperor. They are so effective that even Emperor Palpatine's most dedicated followers grow to fear them, something that strengthens the antialien sentiment among many of the Emperor's closest advisers. The Umbarans are particularly disliked by officers of Imperial Intelligence, who resent the fact that they are subject to Umbaran scrutiny- a resentment that grows every time the Umbarans unmask a Rebel double agent in their ranks. <\/p>\n <p>After the death of Emperor Palpatine and the collapse of his government, the Umbarans find themselves under threat from the Rebels they had hunted and the New Order supporters they had intimidated. When former head of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard forges a powerful coalition on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a> dedicated to reestablishing a strong Galactic Empire, the remaining Umbarans flee the planet, knowing that Isard will seek brutal revenge for the embarrassments they caused her organization when she was rising through the ranks of Imperial Intelligence. <\/p>\n <p>Even before the fall of the Empire, however, Umbarans already begin to retreat from the galaxy. As the full scope of Emperor Palpatine's evil becomes more evident and knowledge of the atrocities committed in his name more widespread, the Umbarans grow embarrassed over Moore's association with the Emperor, and they resume their reclusive ways. In fact, they withdraw even more fully than before, fearing retribution from the many <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> surrounding them. <\/p>\n <p>As memories of the Empire start to fade in the minds of the galaxy's beings, Umbarans begin to filter back out into the galaxy in the low numbers typical of their off-world presence during the Old Republic. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Umbaran_Characteristics\">Umbaran Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Umbarans seem aloof, distant, and cold to all but their closest friends and family members, and it is a rare observer who has the patience to wait for an Umbaran to let his or her guard down. As such, the few Umbarans active beyond their homeworld tend to be regarded by other beings as ciphers. Because of this emotional distance, many non-Umbarans mistakenly assume that Umbarans are indifferent to those around them. Nothing could be further from the truth. Although Umbarans keep their own affairs private, they constantly and quietly try to learn as much as they can about the affairs of others. The Umbaran knack for uncovering secrets has led to rumors that all members of the Species are telepaths, but the truth is that they move about unnoticed simply because of their outsider status, listening and observing all the while. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Umbarans are thinly built humanoids with sunken eyes and pallid skin tones that range from snowy white to pale blue. Male Umbarans stand between 1.7 and 2 meters tall; females tend to be shorter and slighter of build. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Umbarans age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-10 Years <\/td> \n    <td>11-15 Years <\/td> \n    <td>16-44 Years <\/td> \n    <td>45-69 Years <\/td> \n    <td>70-89 Years <\/td> \n    <td>90+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> Umbarans originate from the isolated, dark world of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Umbara (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVW1iYXJhP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Umbara<\/a> on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim\" title=\"The Outer Rim\">The Outer Rim<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p><b>Languages:<\/b> Umbarans learn their own language of Umbarese in infancy, and most learn Basic before the end of their childhood. <\/p>\n <p><b>Example Names:<\/b> Sly Moore, Hant Tuff, Zan Palton. <\/p>\n <p><b>Adventurers:<\/b> Most Umbaran adventurers are hard-bitten loners who come off as antisocial in their interactions with others.

These campaigns saw entire races being hunted to extinction by the savage Esh-kha, who expanded into their conquered worlds. The population of the Esh-kha expanded as their living space increased and this led to the rise of a new rival patriarch, even as the old one was still alive. Such an event was unmarked by this Species and this new patriarch, known as Hallow Voice, proposed a more peaceful approach in their dealings with other races through cooperation. As the Esh-kha population grew too large, Hallow Voice took a number of his followers away who settled on other worlds in order to reach out to other nearby cultures. <\/p>\n <p> Despite their works, the Esh-kha were too well known for violence and mass destruction, and only a few tentative alliances are formed.

Once there, they were imprisoned within the Tomb in stasis beneath the surface, where they were kept in a conscious state.

Gaunt and with sharp teeth that clearly indicate carnivorous tendencies, Pau'ans move with a deliberate pace and have soft, gravelly voices that are calming to hear. Pau'ans are taller than most <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans<\/a> (Though not as tall as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wookiees\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wookiees\">Wookiees<\/a>) and have long, slender fingers that end in nails that closely resemble talons.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Xenobiologists from the University of Sanbra have uncovered connections between the Pau'ans and the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Utai\" title=\"Utai\">Utai<\/a>, the smaller Species with whom they share the planet of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Utapau\" title=\"Utapau\">Utapau<\/a>. Genetic sampling has confirmed a few tenuous biological links, though the exact evolutionary process by which the Pau'an Species developed separately from the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Utai\" title=\"Utai\">Utai<\/a> is still a mystery. Xenoanthropologists date the first Pau'an civilizations back almost 57,000 years before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, making theirs one of the youngest known civilizations. Though no written history of this time exists, scientists currently theorize that the long-lived Pau'ans are genetically closer to their progenitor Species, and that as a result of their longevity the Pau'ans have likely only evolved a little since the planet was settled. <\/p>\n <p>Some time in the last ten thousand years, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Utapau\" title=\"Utapau\">Utapau<\/a> underwent a climate change that caused winds on the surface of the world to reach and maintain constant bursts at destructive speeds. Experts from the University of Sanbra speculate that the climate change was likely very sudden (At least, sudden in geological terms) given the fact that the Pau'an Species did not evolve or adapt to the high winds as many other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> did. The long gap between Pau'an generations caused by their extremely long lives was probably responsible for this evolutionary stumbling block, and were it not for the migration of Pau'an civilization underground they might not have survived the climate change. <\/p>\n <p>The shift to life underground did not change the Species' eating habits, as they maintained many of the biological signs of a carnivorous diet. The ecology of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Utapau\" title=\"Utapau\">Utapau<\/a>, particularly with regard to an abundance of animal life in sinkholes and below ground, allowed the Pau'ans to retain their carnivorous ways, which persist into modern times. <\/p> \n <h3><span id=\"Pau'an_Characteristics\"><\/span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pau.27an_Characteristics\">Pau'an Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Despite their appearances, Pau'ans are exceptionally friendly on the whole and are particularly kind toward outsiders.

Era<\/a>, the existence of the Ssi-Ruuk was unknown to the general galactic population. An escalating war with the competing empire of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chiss\" title=\"Chiss\">Chiss<\/a> forced the Ssi-Ruuk to look toward the galactic Core for \"Recruits\" for their space fleet. The Ssi-Ruuvi forces consisted mostly of self-propelled Battle Droids powered by the life energies and enslaved consciousness of captured humanoids subjected to a process \"Entechment.\" <\/p>\n <p>The Ssi-Ruuk attacked and subjected the citizens of a number of isolated <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Outer Rim\">Outer Rim<\/a> settlements before clashing directly with the Empire's fleet. Rather than bringing the full might of the Imperial Navy to bear on the Ssi-Ruuk invaders, the Emperor negotiated to a secret treaty with them. Using prisoners and slaves as some of the raw materials for Battle Droids appealed to the Emperor; in exchange for data on the Ssi-Ruuk entechment process, Palpatine secretly ceded a number of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Outer Rim\">Outer Rim<\/a> systems to the Ssi-Ruuk to do with as they pleased.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>One of these star systems was <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bakura\" title=\"Bakura\">Bakura<\/a>, a small colony that had been settled by a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> religious fringe group centuries before. While the Emperor saw no value to it, its governor had at his disposal forces that were skilled enough to repel the initial Ssi-Ruuvi strike. The governor sent a desperate message to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a>, notifying them of the unidentified invading force and asking for reinforcements. The message went unanswered by the governor's Imperial masters- but <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance<\/a> intercepted the message and dispatched a task force to help shortly after the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a>. This represented the first time the factions in the Galactic Civil War would have to declare a temporary truce to deal with an outside threat. <\/p>\n <p>After successfully defeating the Ssi-Ruuvi armada at Bakura, the Alliance mounted an offensive against the Ssi-Ruuk Empire. This led to on-again, off-again diplomatic talks with the Ssi-Ruuk, who lacked the resources to wage war on two fronts. Diplomatic talks with the Ssi-Ruuk continue well into <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era\" title=\"The New Jedi Order Era\">The New Jedi Order Era<\/a>, but they have not completely eliminated border skirmishes. Relations with the Ssi-Ruuk remain tense. <\/p>\n <p>Ssi-Ruuk society is split into strict castes. The color of a Ssi-Ruuk's scales usually dictates his or her caste; for example, russet-colored Ssi-Ruuk represent the military caste, gold-scaled Ssi-Ruuk form the religious caste, and sapphire-blue Ssi-Ruuk represent the noble caste. Black-scaled Ssi-Ruuk are usually trained as assassins, while brown-scaled Ssi-Ruuk have no caste whatsoever and are treated as outcasts. <\/p>\n <p>Like many reptilian beings, the Ssi-Ruuk have poor vision but an excellent sense of smell. Their olfactory sense is so fine that they can even ascertain another being's emotional state with a flick of their black tongues. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ssi-Ruuk_Characteristics\">Ssi-Ruuk Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> The Ssi-Ruuk consider themselves to physically, mentally, and spiritually superior to all other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, which they regard as cattle.

The ceaseless violence prevented the world from developing space travel, and the Rattataki believed they were alone the galaxy- they had no concept of galactic community, and only conquering their neighbors seemed important.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Those that discovered <a class=\"new\" title=\"Rattatak (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvUmF0dGF0YWs/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Rattatak<\/a> were unscrupulous slavers common in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim\" title=\"The Outer Rim\">The Outer Rim<\/a>. The wiry Rattataki themselves proved to be an unpopular export, as they were simply too difficult to train and too violent to contain. But credits could be made by importing slaves to the war barons, who would pay handsomely for any exotic edge in combat.

The largest, known as the Cauldron, hosted the best combatants, and war barons and generals would attend, to seek out the soldiers that would win them their wars. Slavers filled the pits with violent candidates- some would purposely price the more successful warriors out of the purchase range of the Rattataki generals, as their gladiators were more profitable from fighting multiple battles than being sold into military service. But it was a rare gladiator indeed who could survive multiple fights. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rattataki_Characteristics\">Rattataki Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b>&nbsp;The pale-skinned Rattataki are made for battle.

<p>Duinuogwuin, or Star Dragons, are some of the most mysterious beings in the galaxy. Their origins are a complete mystery, and when pressed, most Dragons politely deflect such investigations. As such, very little is known about the Duinuogwuin, though it is well known that they have incredibly long life-spans, and they are often sought by the most powerful of political leaders for counsel on galaxy-influencing matters. There is a high degree of genetic diversity from dragon to dragon, some do not require atmosphere to breathe, instead able to draw on solar radiation for sustenance, while others are merely able to hold their breath for months at a time. Some Duinuogwuin can even breathe fire. <\/p>\n <p>Most Star Dragons prefer to live a life of complete isolation, and despite the absolute joy that fills every Duinuogwuin when spending time among their own kind, their conscience forces the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> to wander the galaxy alone. When two Duinuogwuin mate, the offspring is more often beast than child, and researchers speculate that everything from the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exogorths\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Exogorths\">Exogorths<\/a> to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Krayt_Dragons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Krayt Dragons\">Krayt Dragons<\/a> or the <a class=\"new\" title=\"Kadri-ra (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvS2FkcmktcmE/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Kadri-ra<\/a> are the results of their less successful unions. It is theorized that at one time in the distant past; the Duinuogwuin did not restrain their drive to reproduce, and unleashed a thousand horrors upon the galaxy, resulting in them being hunted, and their world being destroyed. While this would explain their guilt and self-imposed isolation from most sentients, it remains a theory. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Duinuogwuin_Characteristics\">Duinuogwuin Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Because of their incredibly long lives, often spanning two millennia, Star Dragons are amongst the wisest sentients in the galaxy. However, their long life-span makes them cautious to act, typically preferring to let time solve all problems. Duinuogwuin place a high value on solitude, and prefer to spend their time exploring all the sights the galaxy has to offer. However, some Duinuogwuin are born with a much less passive view on the galaxy. These evil beings are manipulative, and feel it is silly the Duinuogwuin don't rule the galaxy with their mighty intellect and wisdom. Most Duinuogwuin of this disposition are put down by their fellow dragons quickly, but some escape to cause trouble for the galaxy. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Large, long dragons with segmented, caterpillar-like bodies, with each segment supporting a pair of legs and wings. The most forward segment supports the neck and head, and has arms instead of legs. Their head has a much more canine appearance, and their bodies are covered in fine, soft scales, nearly giving the appearance of skin. Coloration varies slightly among grey tones of white, silver, blue, black and purple. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Duinuogwuin age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-20 Years <\/td> \n    <td>21-100 Years <\/td> \n    <td>101-650 Years <\/td> \n    <td>651-1,200 Years <\/td> \n    <td>1,201-2,000 Years <\/td> \n    <td>2,001+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> Unknown, though there is a mythical \u201cGraveyard of the Dragons\u201d, which most Duinuogwuin return to at the end of their lives.

Experiencing pleasure in its myriad forms is the lifetime pursuit of all Zeltrons. They are a fun-loving species, placing recreation before other, less worldly interests. Members of the species are found throughout the galaxy, for they enjoy traveling, meeting new people, indulging in their passions, and experiencing new things. <\/p>\n <p>Zeltrons are born with a latent empathy that allows them to sense the emotions of others. Though not ruled by emotions of others, they can, over time, become inundated with negative feelings if they are surrounded by such sentiments for a prolonged period of time. For this reason, many Zeltrons are pacifistic, preferring peaceful negotiation to the destructive actions of combat. This is not to say that Zeltrons are incapable of defending themselves; their passion gives them a great capacity for violence when the situation warrants. Additionally, their physiology includes an ultra efficient metabolism which allows them to maintain peak body weight and muscle mass regardless of their culinary indulgences. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Zeltron_Characteristics\">Zeltron Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Zeltrons are almost universally friendly, jolly, and sociable. They love meeting and interacting with new people, visiting new places, and enjoying new experiences. They are benignly manipulative insofar as they strive to be uplifting. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Though their cheerful demeanor and easy smiles can make them seem flippant, Zeltrons can be very serious when the occasion demands it. They are especially concerned with the well-being of their friends and loved ones, and a sure-fire way to anger a Zeltron is to place his or her friends or family in danger. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Nearly all Zeltrons are considered to be attractive by <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> standards. Ugly Zeltrons are unheard of, and plain Zeltrons are rare.

Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>When the Yinchorr System was first charted five centuries before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, explorers found it resource-poor and unworthy of colonization. Further, the Yinchorri were deemed too primitive to be any great boon to the Republic. So, they were largely ignored until a year before the Invasion of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo\" title=\"Naboo\">Naboo<\/a>, when they officially joined the Republic. They gained interstellar travel capabilities, most likely from stolen technology, shortly after their admission into the Galactic Senate. <\/p>\n <p>Slavers quickly learned to avoid the Yinchorr System, as the Yinchorri made terrible slaves- they tended to fight to the death rather than be enslaved, while individuals were so uncooperative that they either starved themselves to death or had to be put down.<\/p>\n <p>Until shortly before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a>, the Yinchorri lived in city states, with each community fielding its own any and having its own leaders, usually a Council of Elders. Each city-state had a number of satellite communities that grew food and mined resources for the central city, and a city's power was measured by how many smaller settlements are needed to keep it supplied. For many centuries, Tol-Kachorn was the mightiest of ail Yinchorri city-states, with nearly one hundred villages and five other cities and attendant communities under its rule. Other cities occasionally tried to equal or rival Tol-Kachorn, which led to brutal campaigns of conquest. Followed by widespread chaos in the region once the emerging empire collapsed. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Yinchorri initially went unnoticed and undisturbed by the Emperor's New Order; as the system contained few resources, no one felt the need to call attention to the obstinate Species that dwelled there. The one exception- and one of Yinchorr's greatest tragedies- was when the system's Imperial governor decided the Yinchorri could serve as the perfect bait in a plot to capture Princess Leia (And advance his career past a dead-end posting ln a useless star system). He captured the leaders of the various Yinchorri Councils of Elders and offered to trade their lives back to the Yinchorri in exchange for Leia. The Yinchorri people felt that the life of one <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> was an adequate price for their beloved eiders, so they set a trap for the Rebel leader. When the governor tried to double-cross the Yinchorri, the angry natives overthrew him and his regime. <\/p>\n <p>After becoming fully aware of the evil of the Empire, the Tol-Kachorn Council of Elders threw their support behind <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance<\/a>. As the Rebellion established bases in the Yinchorr System, other Yinchorri city-states offered their warriors and Starships to the fight as well. <\/p>\n <p>The Empire punished the Yinchorri for their revolt. The sector's Moff, with the full blessing of the Imperial High Command, ordered a massive assault against <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yinchorr\" title=\"Yinchorr\">Yinchorr<\/a>, and shortly after the fall of Echo Base on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hoth\" title=\"Hoth\">Hoth<\/a>, the Rebel bases in the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yinchorr\" title=\"Yinchorr\">Yinchorr<\/a> system were leveled. The cities of Yinchorri were also pounded to rubble by orbital bombardments- even the long history of mighty Tol-Kachorn ended that day. The surviving Yinchorri were reduced to living as nomadic tribes. The devastation on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yinchorr\" title=\"Yinchorr\">Yinchorr<\/a> came to the Emperor's personal attention a few months later, and shortly before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a> he ordered all training facilities of his elite personal guard to be consolidated in that system. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yinchorr\" title=\"Yinchorr\">Yinchorr<\/a> remained under Imperial domination until nearly a decade after the destruction of the Yinchorri cities; the system was liberated by New Republic forces as part of the campaign to reclaim the territory seized by the forces led by what was reportedly the Emperor's clone. <\/p>\n <p>The surviving Yinchorri came together under the banner of the last son of the leader of Tol-Kachorn's Elder Council. They have since settled in the heavily defended complex once used as the headquarters of the Emperor's Imperial Guard and are currently trying to rebuild their civilization. Yinchorr remains an independent star system into <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era\" title=\"The New Jedi Order Era\">The New Jedi Order Era<\/a>. While the system continues to host a New Republic military base and a small Starship repair facility, the Yinchorri have not yet applied for membership in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p>From the moment they hatch, the Yinchorri join tightly knit, highly supportive communities- first their parents and clutchmates, later the entire village they grow up in, then their professional peers and superiors, and finally, a family of their own. When a Yinchorri mates, he or she does so for life, and it is quite common for a widowed individual to die from sorrow within a few days of losing his or her spouse. While the Yinchorri have taken to space travel, few have settled off their homeworld. Those who have, however have brought their entire extended family with them, essentially transplanting entire villages at a time. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Yinchorri_Characteristics\">Yinchorri Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b>&nbsp;Yinchorri are resolute, pragmatic, and possessive. They believe that if they're strong enough to take something and hold on to it, it is, by right, theirs.

are short humanoids native to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine\" title=\"Tatooine\">Tatooine<\/a>. The Jawas have a poor reputation and are regarded as thieves at best, vermin at worst. Their off-putting nature is made worse by the sour smell that clings to them and their inexplicable and nonsensical language. Jawas survive by scavenging lost technology in the desert wastes. \"Lost\" for Jawas is ambiguous; they are likely to snatch up anything that's not bolted down. Moisture farmers and others who live far from Spaceports regularly find that their belongings have vanished in the night with only tell-tale Jawa tracks leading off into the wasteland.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Jawas are intelligent and have a complex society. Gathering in extended tribes, Jawa life revolves around trade- not for wealth, but for survival. Jawas look for guidance from their shamans, usually a female Jawa with the ability to portent the future and cast vicious hexes. Once a year, the Jawa tribes gather in the Dune Sea to exchange sons and daughters, to swap stories and news, and to mingle among their own kind. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jawa_Characteristics\">Jawa Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Jawas are peaceful, preferring flight to confrontations. They are, however, extremely cunning and capable of great treachery if given cause. A fleeing Jawa seeks out its allies and comes back in numbers to deal with threats. Even then, Jawas rarely confront their enemies directly, preferring to sabotage or steal vital equipment and let the desert do the nasty work for them. A Jawa can become fierce- even vicious- when cornered or when a shaman is threatened. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Jawas wear brown hooded cloaks to protect themselves from the oppressive heat of the twin suns of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine\" title=\"Tatooine\">Tatooine<\/a>. They dip their clothing in a rancid soup to better seal in their moisture. This gives them their infamously unpleasant odor. Jawas have sensitive, glowing orange eyes and are easily blinded by bright light.

Lacking the organs to form words in Basic, and confronted with the fact that other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> cannot speak Jawa, they developed a shorthand speech called the Jawa Trade Language.

A Krevaaki Child uses all its tentacles, but Adults stand upright on six of them, using the other two the way other beings use their hands.

href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Troiken<\/a>. Almost seventeen thousand years ago, rogue <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanian\" title=\"Arkanian\">Arkanian<\/a> scientists moved their primitive forebearers to the Quermia System. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanians\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arkanians\">Arkanians<\/a> terraformed the new Quermian homeworld into a bucolic splendor. The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanians\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arkanians\">Arkanians<\/a> then conducted a variety of genetic manipulations upon the transplanted <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Xexto\" title=\"Xexto\">Xexto<\/a> and watched how they evolved. Within a few generations, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanians\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arkanians\">Arkanians<\/a> moved on to other experiments, leaving the Quermians to their own evolution.<\/p>\n <p>Over the following ten thousand years, the Quermians developed a highly advanced society on their garden world. With no dangerous predators, plenty of rich soil, and warm seas providing potable water full of vital minerals and nutrients, the gangly invertebrates nearly achieved paradise. By the time Old Republic scouts arrived in the star system, the Quermians had settled other nearby worlds and were on the verge of exploring the galaxy at large. They welcomed the strange visitors from the stars. Within a few decades, they were active participants in the galactic community. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Quermians are famous for their apparent telepathic ability. Quermians can communicate nonverbally by locking eyes with one another. Quermians deny they have telepathy, claiming that they are merely highly attuned to each other's body language. Xenobiologists doubt this claim, pointing to highly unusual activity in parts of Quermian brains, but so far no hard evidence has been provided to confirm or deny psychic powers on the part of all Quermians. <\/p>\n <p>Quermian society encourages advanced and complicated philosophical contemplation. Their Species includes some of the galaxy's greatest thinkers. During <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Rebellion Era\">The Rebellion Era<\/a>, however, the Emperor's New Order forced Quermian teachers and philosophers from their positions at universities across the galaxy. During the Jedi Purge, most withdrew to their home system. Many of their number were prominent Jedi, but even non-Jedi Quermians fell victim to mob violence. New Order fanatics claimed that all Quermians were Jedi, and that they beamed evil thoughts into other beings' minds using their telepathic powers. Shortly before the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion, the Quermian planetary government began taking steps to rejoin the galactic community. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Quermian_Characteristics\">Quermian Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Quermians are a gentle, unassuming people.

The hands of one set of arms contain their olfactory glands. Their heads sway almost hypnotically at the end of a long neck. Deeply set small eyes rest above a lipless mouth that seems permanently set in a bemused smile. The Quermian brain is split between the head and chest cavity. Skin color ranges from ashen white to dark gray. Adults of the Species stand between 1.6 and 2.3 meters tall, with no difference in size between males and females. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b> Quermians age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-11 Years <\/td> \n    <td>12-16 Years <\/td> \n    <td>17-42 Years <\/td> \n    <td>43-65 Years <\/td> \n    <td>66-85 Years <\/td> \n    <td>86+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table>\n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> The beautiful Outer Rim planet of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Quermia\" title=\"Quermia\">Quermia<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p><b>Languages:<\/b> Quermians have their own spoken and written language.

Accounts of Gen'Dai living to be over four thousand standard years old are common. They are a hardy Species, thanks in part to their unique physiology.

colonies with distinctive cultural and ethnic traits. They have a reputation as moody and dangerous beings who attack with little provocation. Despite (Or perhaps because of) their ferocious reputation, Zehethbra are sought out as bodyguards and soldiers by legitimate governments and criminal organizations alike. <\/p>\n <p>Zehethbra have hair-trigger tempers, and spats between competing individuals can be fierce. While fatalities are rare, more than a few young Zehethbra have perished by allowing their tempers get the better of them when facing down an elder. They have a strong sense of social status and will defer to individuals that prove to be clearly in charge. <\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Outraged Zehethbra will release a powerful biochemical spray that stuns and disorients anyone caught in the blast.

When angered, a Zehethbra will growl, snarl, and spit at the source of the discomfort, hurling terrible epithets at enemies. Despite their irritable attitude, Zehethbra are fiercely protective of their families and clans. They are territorial and do not like having their personal space violated. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b>&nbsp;Zehethbra are furry, muscular bipeds with fangs. Their fur ranges in color from black to speckled brown. A broad white stripe runs from their noses, up over their heads, and down their backs. Their pawlike hands have claws that add to their fierce appearance but are too small to deal significant damage in combat. A Zehethbra adult stands 1.9 to 2.3 meters tall. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Zehethbra age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th> <p>CHILD <\/p> <\/th> \n    <th> <p>YOUNG ADULT <\/p> <\/th> \n    <th> <p>ADULT <\/p> <\/th> \n    <th> <p>MIDDLE AGE <\/p> <\/th> \n    <th> <p>OLD <\/p> <\/th> \n    <th> <p>VENERABLE <\/p> <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td> <p>1-9 Years <\/p> <\/td> \n    <td> <p>10-15 Years <\/p> <\/td> \n    <td> <p>16-44 Years <\/p> <\/td> \n    <td> <p>45-64 Years <\/p> <\/td> \n    <td> <p>65-84 Years <\/p> <\/td> \n    <td> <p>85+ Years <\/p> <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> <a class=\"new\" title=\"Zeheth (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvWmVoZXRoP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Zeheth<\/a>, a temperate planet located in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim\" title=\"The Mid Rim\">The Mid Rim<\/a>.

The Empire maintained this policy, but the Kubaz grew increasingly eager to extend their knowledge of the galaxy during the Rebellion era and committed greater resources toward developing or acquiring hyperspace technology.

<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Killik_Hivemind\" title=\"The Killik Hivemind\">The Killik Hivemind<\/a><\/i> <\/p>\n <p>Once major players on the galactic stage, the Killiks are long gone by the time the first <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans<\/a> reach the Killik spawnworld of <a

From their new home in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a>, the Killiks subsist for millennia until upsetting the political balance in the Swarm War of 36 ABY. <\/p>\n <p>Killiks are a genetically diverse population of intelligent insects. Their society is composed of hives, also called nests. Members of each hive share the same physical characteristics and possess the ability to communicate with others through pheromones, electromagnetic transmissions, and long-distance telepathy. <\/p>\n <p>Multiple nests united under a hive-mind link can be considered a single organism. Its members always refer to themselves in the third person, and each is aware of anything that has been experienced by any other member. The Hive Mind can be thought of as the individual, and the Killiks its eyes, ears, and hands.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Most Killiks are female. Males are needed for reproduction and little else, and they are birthed in great numbers only to help seed a new nest. A breeding female can lay a thousand eggs per month, hatching larvae that grow into work-ready nymphs in under a year. <\/p>\n <p>Killiks have the ability to turn outsiders into fellow hive members or \"Joiners,\" a quality that members of other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> find unnerving. This is accomplished through exposure to mind-altering pheromones, and the process is widely considered to be brainwashing, although the victims usually report rapturous fulfillment at the sensation that they finally belong. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Killik_Characteristics\">Killik Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Killik hives can be distinguished not only from their members' appearance but also from their job specialties. Some hives consist of superior warriors, whereas others excel at construction, music-making, subterfuge, or scouting. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Although there is great variation in Killik phenotypes, all share certain qualities. The majority have six limbs, hopping on the back two while using the front four to manipulate objects. Their bodies are sheathed in hard chitinous exoskeletons, but their joints are lightly armored for flexibility (And are therefore vulnerable). Killiks have oversized compound eyes and waving antennae, and they breathe through tiny spiracles lining their abdomens. Chitin color comes in every hue and shade, although members of the same hive share similar coloration patterns. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Killiks age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-4 Years <\/td> \n    <td>5-9 Years <\/td> \n    <td>10-39 Years <\/td> \n    <td>40-54 Years <\/td> \n    <td>55-59 Years <\/td> \n    <td>60+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> By 30,000 BBY, the Killiks abandon the civilized galaxy, leaving nothing behind but hive mounds on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Alderaan\" title=\"Alderaan\">Alderaan<\/a> and similar structures on the nearby world of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Alsakan\" title=\"Alsakan\">Alsakan<\/a>.

Roughly four thousand years before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, a supernova destroyed the planet.

Neti are extremely long lived, with an average lifespan of several thousand years. A Neti reproduces by creating a few seeds, but this occurs only once every few centuries. Seeds often sit for over a thousand years before germinating. <\/p>\n <p>Neti are also capable of changing their size and shape at will. A skilled Neti can morph its shape to a roughly humanoid form, a squat quadrupedal shape, or a solid treelike mass anywhere from 2 to 9.5 meters tall.

user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>When Old Republic scouts first made contact with the Toong, the Species was in the early stages of explorationing their solar system. The appearance of alien beings in ships with technology beyond anything the Toong had imagined threw their planet into chaos. The revelation triggered a war between many of their homeworld's nations. Covert observation of the Species by first-contact specialists assigned to the scouting mission indicated that the Toong were a peaceful and outgoing Species, so the panic and violence that followed first contact came as a complete shock to the scouts. It took weeks to reestablish contact with the Toong, and only then did Republic diplomats and scouts realize they had overlooked something: although highly evolved mentally, the Toong Species retains a keen fight-or-flight instinct that frequently manifests as acute social anxiety. The sudden appearance of strange beings from the stars caused mass panic. A tremendous effort on the part of the first-contact team and Jedi Councilors hastily dispatched from <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a> prevented massive warfare that would have destroyed Toong society. <\/p>\n <p> Once the Toong became comfortable with the idea of being part of a great galactic community, they united under a single planetary government and joined <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic\" title=\"The Old Republic\">The Old Republic<\/a>. They took quickly to the more advanced technology; within a few centuries after contact, Toong bases and settlements could be found throughout the Toong'L System. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Toong reluctantly expanded beyond their own star system, giving rise to scattered colonies throughout the galaxy. These colonies are typically organized around mining or farming efforts, and the Toong colonists enjoy minimal contact with other sentient <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. A few rare Toong work outside the Toong'L System or its colonies as accountants, mechanics, or even scouts and bounty hunters, but more often than not, they gravitate to positions where they don't have to interact with others. <\/p>\n <p>Visitors to Toong'L are often surprised to learn that rocket-jumping, Podracing, and aircar demolition debris are favorite pastimes among the Toong. Further, many raiders who felt Toong ships or communities would be easy targets for piracy realized Toong fight back if forced into a corner by excessive demands or obvious threats to their livelihood. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Toong_Characteristics\">Toong Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Toong exhibit extreme nervousness in social situations. They invariably give in whenever challenged vocally or physically, particularly when facing non-Toong. A typical Toong feels safe only with his or her immediate family. This has caused most other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> to view the Toong as cowards, but they do not fear combat and other dangerous situations.

However they might find strength in the fact that Crado's mate Sylvar was able to turn away from the dark path, and regain the Jedi way. <\/p>\n <p>How Cathar are viewed in the galaxy depends on the exact time frame of the game.

The Cathar begin resettling their planet after the Mandalorian Wars, working to rebuild their society.

prejudice that marks shape-shifters, then it is the Stennes Shifters. Like other shape-shifters, there is very little known about the Stennes Shifters, save that it is a genetic offshoot of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Human\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Near-Human\">Near-Human<\/a> Stennes race. Ancient records indicate that more was known about the Species in the ancient past of the Republic, but those records are incomplete and largely incomprehensible. <\/p>\n <p> The Jedi Knights of 5,000 years ago faced the Stennes Shifters, and recognized them as a threat. The records indicate that <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi<\/a> of that era decimated the Species, and today estimates place the Stennes Shifter population anywhere from several million to less than a thousand. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Legend tells of the dangers of the Stennes Shifters. These beings have been alternatively named \"Force-eaters,\" due to their eerie natural abilities. The Stennes Shifters have a bizarre sensitivity to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a>. This in itself is not unheard of, as the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gotal\" title=\"Gotal\">Gotal<\/a> and non-sentient <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vornskr\" title=\"Vornskr\">Vornskr<\/a> have a limited natural sensitivity to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a>. However, the Stennes Shifters' ability to use <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a> is possibly unique. <\/p>\n <p>Stennes Shifters draw power from expended Force energy. If those within the vicinity alter the flow of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a> around them, the Stennes Shifters gain its energy. Furthermore, legends state that Stennes Shifters can tap the stored Force within unwary beings, like the vampires that lurk in the mythologies of many cultures. <\/p>\n <p>No known Stennes Shifter has ever been medically examined in recent history, so whether these powers are true or only wild conjecture is unknown. The standard Stennes shows no exotic physiological developments that would suggest these abilities. <\/p>\n <p>The Stennes Shifters' shifting ability is not based on physical change, but on telepathic manipulation. Whether this is a Force-based ability is unknown. It is known that this ability does not extend to mechanical optical devices, like photoreceptors and holocams. The Stennes Shifter appears in its normal form: a slight humanoid with grayish skin and a sunken, skull-like face. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stennes_Shifter_Characteristics\">Stennes Shifter Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> The Stennes <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Humans\" title=\"Near-Humans\">Near-Humans<\/a> are a xenophobic lot, as millenia of persecution has ensured that many non-Shifters have been killed.

These tall aliens are the result of generations of selective breeding and genetic modification that began when their world suffered a drastic change in climate. These restrictive breeding programs have made Kaminoans an extremely adaptable Species. Apart from gender, Kaminoans have little variation, and to the untrained eye they all look the same. Subtle variations have been introduced into their genetic codes, however, allowing for diversity within a strict set of parameters. <\/p>\n <p>The economy of Kamino is based on cloning for profit, but not every Kaminoan is a cloner by trade. The majority of Kaminoans support their communities with various skills and specialized abilities. They strive to perform their work flawlessly, and seek perfection. Because Kaminoans are moderately xenophobic and rarely venture away from their homeworld, they are a rare sight in other parts of the galaxy. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kaminoan_Characteristics\">Kaminoan Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Kaminoans see themselves as superior to other forms of life. They harbor a private intolerance for imperfection, but they are, nonetheless, polite to outsiders. To a Kaminoan, any Species that seeks self improvement is worthy of respect, but those who do not are obviously inferior and deserve their inevitable decline. This attitude is reflected in their cloning processes, where entire crops of clones might be eliminated due to a single, subtle flaw. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Kaminoans are tall and gaunt, with pale skin, three-fingered hands, and long necks.

href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a>, an arid world in the Teke Ro System. <\/p>\n <p>Arcona society is less technologically evolved than what is considered the galactic norm. The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> did not develop space travel on their own, but shortly after Republic scouts made contact with the world many decades ago, entire villages sought employment with the Republic and interstellar corporations, fascinated by the possibility of exploring the galaxy. In all three major <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eras_of_Play\" title=\"Eras of Play\">Eras of Play<\/a>, most worlds located at trade-route junctions have at least one Arcona colony, and Arcona can be found at virtually every large spaceport- either as travelers or operators of businesses. <\/p>\n <p>While most beings consider Arcona cities on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a> quality low-tech, the planet has several impressive starports, and many of the galaxy's mining companies operate on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a>. The system in general, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a> in particular, boasts rich rare-mineral deposits. Water is the most precious substance on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a>, so the Arcona sold the mining rights to the firms for massive shipments of water. Although the Arcona derive many essential nutrients directly from the world's atmosphere, they also need to consume water and other liquids to keep secondary circulatory systems in their bodies healthy. (This has led some planetary geologists to hypothesize that <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a> lost much of it's water in some geologically recent catastrophe, though this remains unproven.)<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>When it was discovered the Arcona can easily and hopelessly become addicted to sodium chloride (Salt) by ingesting even a gram or two of the substance, unscrupulous merchants almost destroyed Arcona society by creating several generations of salt addicts. Salt induces vivid, colorful hallucinations in Arcona, but repeated use damages their body's ability to absorb life-giving ammonia. Only the intervention of the Republic saved the Arcona. The Senate passed draconian laws that punished the importation of salt to the Teke Ro System or to Arcona communities elsewhere in the galaxy, and the Arcona themselves zealously police their communities. Arcona addicted to salt are easily identifiable; their multifaceted eyes turn from green to gold. <\/p>\n <p>The center of Arcona society is the family, and communities consist of several loosely affiliated extended families. The entire family (Extended and biological) is considered when making even the simplest decisions. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arcona_Characteristics\">Arcona Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> An individual Arcona almost always uses the pronoun \"We\" instead of \"I.\" Male Arcona raise the young, since Arcona females are typically impulsive thrill-seekers. As such, females are particularly prone to risking salt addiction, while males go to great lengths to keep the substance out of their communities. In fact, male Arcona are renowned for their conservative outlooks and strong commitment to maintaining order at the cost of individual ambitions and desires. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Arcona have thick skin that ranges in color from mahogany to ebony, and triangular heads with large multifaceted eyes that seem to sparkle.

They are well adapted to the harsh conditions of their home planet and are remarkably strong and resilient. Unfortunately, these very traits have made them perfect targets for slavers, who use them for hard physical labor. Despite their massive size and intimidating demeanor, Nazren are not a warlike Species. This proved to be their downfall when the Empire arrived and began enslaving them. However, they are not pacifists, either, and their will and ability to fight back grew slowly but surely. <\/p>\n <p>Nazren typically wear sleeveless tunics tucked into black hide pants and heavy boots. Their clothes are normally fastened with hooks or clamps on the end of short lengths of cord or attached belts. Pads that strap onto the shoulders (To cushion a heavy load) and arm bracers are common, also attached with the hook system. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nazren_Characteristics\">Nazren Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Nazren are pragmatic, serious, and traditional.

Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide<\/a><\/i> <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Arkanian society and history are among the most complex in the Old Republic. At different times in its history, Arkanian has belonged to both the Republic and the Sith Empire, and played important roles in each. Knowledge and research are extremely important to the Arkanians, and they are highly skilled academicians and scientists. It is therefore not surprising that <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkania\" title=\"Arkania\">Arkania<\/a> would become a main repository of the history of the Sith Empire, as well as home to vast libraries of information from across the galaxy. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Arkanians are not afraid to profit from their research and high intelligence. Arkanian corporations amass wealth by bringing key medical treatments and technology to the market at opportune times. Many in the galaxy find the Arkanians arrogant and aloof. They are horrified by the direction of some Arkanian research, particularly their work in genetic engineering. Indeed, the Arkanians are known to have transformed entire <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> over the course of generations, often to the detriment of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>.&nbsp; <\/p>\n <p>Even the Arkanian Species itself had not been off-limits to research and genetic engineering. Specific subspecies, such as the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoots\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoots\">Arkanian Offshoots<\/a>, were engineered for specific tasks. However, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoots\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoots\">Arkanian Offshoots<\/a> are less harder and shorter lived than the original Arkanians- a trait not helped by occasional attempts by racist Purebloods to wipe them out. They also differ in physical appearance, typically in skin tone, eyes, and ears. Reactions to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoots\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoots\">Arkanian Offshoots<\/a> vary widely within Arkanian society. Much to the horror of the occasional outsiders who visit <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoot\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoot\">Arkanian Offshoot<\/a> communities, some Arkanian regard them as merely tools or as a slave <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. However, such feelings are not universal. Many regard the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoots\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoots\">Arkanian Offshoots<\/a> as an example of the cruel consequences of Arkanian corporate greed. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arkanian_Characteristics\">Arkanian Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Arkanians are arrogant and regard themselves superior to all other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>.

were simple hunters before <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Duros\" title=\"Duros\">Duros<\/a> scouts discovered them during an exploration of the Jiroch System nearly 9,000 years before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>. Although access to galactic-level technology allowed the Tunroth to colonize other planets in their home system, they continued to favor primitive weapons over modern blasters, preferring to hunt wild beasts armed only with the sacred Klirun, the traditional Tunroth hunting <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bow\" title=\"Bow\">Bow<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p>Ten years before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, expansionist Lortan fanatics swept across a dozen systems and destroyed everything in their path. The Reslian Purge, as it became known, wiped out millions of Tunroth. The primitive hunters lacked the weaponry to repel the Lortan invaders. The intervention of the Imperial Navy ended the Reslian Purge, and although the Imperials interceded only to safeguard their own interests, the Tunroth still owed the Empire a debt of gratitude. The Species reluctantly accepted Imperial rule, and many Tunroth became unlikely supporters of the Emperor's New Order. After the fall of the Empire, the Tunroth hesitated to join <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a> for fear of being seen as Imperial sympathizers. However, their fears proved unfounded, as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a> welcomed Tunroth membership. <\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Tunroth live in communes of 50 to 300 individuals, each commune governed by a great hunter. The Assemblage of Three- a body made up of the three highest-level hunters- governs Tunroth society. They assemble whenever an issue that concerns all Tunroth arises, such as the need to colonize more worlds, alleviate overcrowding, or deal with an external threat. <\/p>\n <p>Tunroth leaders who forbade blasters in favor of traditional hunting weapons changed their view after the Reslian Purge, to the point where the Tunroth now stockpile blasters and other modern weapons for the express purpose of defending their communes. The Species' adoption of modern weaponry has not diminished the Tunroth hunting tradition. 27 different levels of Tunroth hunter are known to exist, and each has its own strict guidelines for ascension. The highest of the 27 ranks is <i>Stiilran<\/i>, though no hunters of this class are known to exist during the time of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic\" title=\"The Galactic Republic\">The Galactic Republic<\/a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire\" title=\"The Galactic Empire\">The Galactic Empire<\/a>, or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p>It has long been rumored that some Jedi artifact, such as a temple or hidden tomb, lies somewhere in the Jiroch System.

They are a primitive Species, using only crude technology. Male Nelvaanians are responsible for hunting game and protecting the tribe, while females are responsible for the day-to-day affairs of their tribe, which includes raising cubs. <\/p>\n <p>At the top of the Nelvaanian tribe is the chief, who rules with the help of his mate and a shaman. A tribal chief is not chosen by trial, nor is he elected to his position. Instead, the chief's ascension is determined by the grace of the \"Great Mother\" and is established through a show of mutual admiration and respect among the entire tribe. Religion and spirituality are the center of Nelvaanian society. Elders are revered, as are mothers of all ages. <\/p>\n <p>During the Clone Wars, male Nelvaanians are abducted by the Techno Union and subjected to extensive physiological and genetic manipulation in an attempt to create a race of mutant warriors. The experiments are partially successful, turing the males of the Species into monstrous versions of their former selves. However, the experiments are stopped by Anakin Skywalker, and the modified Nelvaanians reunite with their tribes. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nelvaanian_Characteristics\">Nelvaanian Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Nelvaanians are closely tied by the bonds of family and kinship. They are superstitious, attributing magical powers to most technology, which they mistrust. Nevertheless, they are honorable and faithful once their trust is earned. Genetically modified male Nelvaanians are somewhat less astute than their female counterparts, and this extends to their social graces, as well. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> The Nelvaanians are a humanoid <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> with pronounced canine characteristics. They have blue-green fur, large teeth in a pronounced muzzle, and two pointy, independently movable ears. A thick mane of black hair on their heads extends down the napes of their necks, and this tends to whiten with age. After the experiments of the Techno Union, nearly all Nelvaanian males are transformed into hulking monstrosities due to intense genetic manipulation. This trait persists in males born after the Clone Wars, though females are not subject to the mutation. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\"

When not actively engaged in helping themselves or others, Frozians are often depressed and, despite their best intentions, tend to ruin the mood of those around them as well. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description: <\/b>Frozians are tall, thin humanoids with multiple joints in their arms and legs. This gives them a curious, loping gait when they walk. Their bodies are covered by short fur that ranges from sandy brown to chestnut. They have large brown eyes that are set on either side of a pronounced muzzle, giving the Frozians excellent peripheral vision. From their muzzles grow thick whiskers that the Frozians twitch in elaborate gestures to emphasize their emotions. Adult Frozians stand 3 meters tall, on average, with males and females having comparable builds. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b> Frozians age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-8 Years <\/td> \n    <td>9-13 Years <\/td> \n    <td>14-40 Years <\/td> \n    <td>41-60 Years <\/td> \n    <td>61-84 Years <\/td> \n    <td>85+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table>\n <p><b>Homeworld: <\/b><a class=\"new\" title=\"Froz (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvRnJvej9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Froz<\/a>, a lush world in the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Core_Worlds\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Core Worlds\">Core Worlds<\/a> region.

They believe that change is impossible, a belief fostered by their ability to recover quickly from even the most grievous wounds. The Blooding, a ritual combat between two tribes over water rights, is also used to settle impassable disputes between hated enemies. A Blooding is usually a fight to the death between two Abyssins- one champion per tribe- with the winner gaining all of the loser's possessions. <\/p>\n <p>Abyssins are well suited to their natural desert habitat and have a very efficient biology.

Even the richest Mrlssi live modestly, although they often have huge libraries consisting of rare and obscure texts. Mrlssi are seldom impressed by shows of wealth or power, but they always have great respect for talented intellectuals and scientists. <\/p>\n <p>Mrlssi are natural problem-solvers, and they love mysteries and puzzles. This quality, coupled with keen analytical abilities, is what makes their engineers so good at improving upon existing designs. They can spot a design weakness and work at it until they have found the key to fixing the limitation. Mrlssi enjoy intelligent conversations and tinkering with gadgets, and they love nothing more than friendly debates over the relative strengths of various Starships or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speeders\" title=\"Speeders\">Speeders<\/a>. They also delight in jokes and wordplay, considering themselves among the galaxy's foremost humorists.

The average adult stands between 0.7 and 1.3 meters tall. Their bodies are covered in feathers, but their arms, legs, and faces are scaly. Young Mrlssi have brown or gray feathers, but as they age, they develop brightly colored plumage. Mrlssi have three clawed digits on each of their hands and feet. <\/p>\n <p>Mrlssi speak in high, piping voices. When they communicate in their native language, the sound of their vocalizations is generally considered to be beautiful, but when they speak Basic, their voices are grating to some <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Mrlssi age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-4 Years <\/td> \n    <td>5-8 Years <\/td> \n    <td>9-35 Years <\/td> \n    <td>36-69 Years <\/td> \n    <td>70-89 Years <\/td> \n    <td>90+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> The Mrlssi originate on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mrlsst\" title=\"Mrlsst\">Mrlsst<\/a>, a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Colonies_Region\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Colonies Region\">Colonies Region<\/a> world noted for its lush jungles and institutions of higher learning. <\/p>\n <p><b>Languages:<\/b> Mrlssi know their native language (Mrlsstese) and Basic.

This changes when they encounter Old Republic scouts who seduce them with the power and might of advanced technology. Obsessed by these wonders, the Ubese devote their resources to the development of these technologies. As they succeed, they became worried about aggression from rival systems, so they develop weapon technology, dipping into dangerous devices banned throughout the galaxy. Fearing these weapons in the hands of a decidedly unstable population, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic\" title=\"The Old Republic\">The Old Republic<\/a> makes a preemptive strike against the Ubese to destroy weapons facilities and halt their aggression. The attacks inadvertently detonate those same weapons, resulting in a widespread contamination of all Ubese worlds and the near extinction of the Ubese race. <\/p>\n <p>The only survivors are those on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Uba_IV\" title=\"Uba IV\">Uba IV<\/a>, who struggle to subsist in the ashes of their civilization. The attacks, coupled with The Old Republic's unwillingness to assist the beleaguered people, breed resentment and hatred toward the rest of the galaxy. After thousands of years, the Ubese nurse their animosity until they recover enough to begin again. The Ubese slowly emerge from their world, selling their services as mercenaries and bounty hunters, gaining a name for themselves as merciless warriors who are not above any tactic as long as they get the job done. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ubese_Characteristics\">Ubese Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Ubese are aggressive and warlike.

Thus, they are highly intelligent and pacifistic. Exiled Draethos become enthralled with learning as much as they can, though they might never practically apply their detailed knowledge of a given subject. They dislike debate - even on subject they know extremely well - because Draethos fear overlooking details or being unable to adequately explain what they have learned. Older Draethos eventually overcome this barrier. <\/p>\n <p>Partly due to their long lives, Draethos society is slow to evolve and relies heavily on tradition. Attitudes developed before the Knights of the Old Republic<i> <\/i>era remain central to Draethos society thousands of years later.

A Geonosian from a low caste who volunteers for these battles can, if they survive, achieve some measure of status by distinguishing themselves in the arena- if only in the form of fame, fortune, and the right to be recognized by Aristocrats (Though still not treated quite as equal).

At some point, presumably within three decades before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, Rokur Gepta, the last Sorcerer of Tund, destroyed the planet and all life on it, with his Electromagnetic Torpedo, leaving behind nothing more than a desolate wasteland full of deadly radiation (Except some places where the radiation was held in check by force fields, though even there it would take billions of years for life to grow again). Presumably, the only Cias to have survived were those off-world when the cataclysm occurred. Hence, during the Clone Wars and thereafter, Ciasi are all but extinct. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ciasi_Characteristics\">Ciasi Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p>P<b>ersonality:<\/b>&nbsp;placeholder <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b>&nbsp;The Ciasi are bipedal, digitigrade, rodent-like species, and covered from snout to toe in fur, most commonly some shade of brown in colour, although many have black, grey, or white markings.

Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>The galaxy has seen very little of the T'surr Species, and thankfully so. lts most infamous representative is the notorious pirate and slave trader, Krayn, who not only plundered ships but also sold the captive crew into slavery. T'surr are among the galaxy's most dangerous predators, although their relative scarcity makes them seem less threatening. Although their level of technology does not meet the galactic standard, T'surr capably use technology scavenged from the ships of their victims. <\/p>\n <p> T'surr are not represented on the Galactic Senate during the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic\" title=\"The Galactic Republic\">The Galactic Republic<\/a> or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a> because they are widely regarded as nothing more than dangerous, marauding killers. The harsh living conditions on the T'surr homeworld have created a Species of survivors who care little for others. The wealth of a T'surr is rated by the number and quality of slaves they own.

They like to keep trophies as reminders of their conquests, often wearing these stolen trinkets on their belts. Whereas T'surr males rule the stars, T'surr females rule the homes. For this reason, T'surr males anxiously leave their homeworld, leaving their mates to raise the children. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Hulking brutes, T'surr males stand between 2.3 and 2.6 meters tall.

Their huge heads sport numerous horns, large, sensitive ears, a mouth filled with razor sharp teeth and four gleaming red eyes.

With social evolution and intelligence came knowledge of the nature of their planet. <\/p>\n <p> While their world lacked readily accessible resources like metals or wood, <a class=\"new\" title=\"Lur (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvTHVyP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Lur<\/a> had an abundance of lifeforms, both animal and plant. The Lurrians learned to domesticate certain creatures. They began by taming creatures for food, then transportation, then construction. Eventually, they learned that selective breeding could bring about desirable traits. In time, the Lurrians discovered many natural herbs, roots, and compounds that, when administered to females ready to breed, could bring about dramatic changes in the genetic code of offspring. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Now, these beings have a very advanced culture based on their knowledge of genetic manipulation. While they lack technological tools, many of their newly developed lifeforms perform the functions of these tools.

The Lurrians have bred creatures whose sole purpose is to cultivate genetic code altering plants and herbs or to consume the wastes of their culture. <\/p>\n <p>While genetic manipulation is strictly controlled due to the atrocities of the Clone Wars, there are still those who seek genetic experts. The Empire has quarantined the world due to the Lurrians' abilities, but little effort is made to enforce the quarantine.

<p>The Chistori are a race of obscure saurian humanoids. So scarce is the information of these people that even the Jedi Archives have no information on the Chistori homeworld. What little is known about this Species comes from their interactions with others. Fierce and warlike, they are quick to anger and tend to use excessive force to deal with even the smallest slights.

Theelins inevitably dwindled in number- only a few million Theelin and Theelin hybrids remained by the time the Republic fell, and pure Theelin were extinct by the time of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p>Some of their greatest works were produced in these years, however, as an epitaph for a dying people. Theelin performers and artists created many of The Galactic Republic's greatest works of art. The Theelin Divas, an all-female religious order, were recognized by many scholars of music as the greatest singers in the Galaxy.

The Chev villages are all surrounded by mine fields and fences intended to protect the Chevs from predators and banish any thoughts of escape. <\/p>\n <p> Millennia ago, the Chevs lived in grand cities, but the more aggressive <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> shattered their peaceful civilization. Chev communities exist primarily to supply food and manufactured goods for their nomadic masters, although they are permitted to trade goods between villages. They have a rich culture, filled with folklore, a wide range of musical, dramatic, and artistic forms of expression, and religious traditions. The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> have never made any effort to discourage the Chevs from practicing their cultural rites within the boundaries of their settlements, as the overlords find the activities interesting to watch and believe it helps increase the productivity of the slaves. Also, aspects of Chev religious beliefs exist that the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> find suits their purposes- such as ancient myths describing how the Chevs would be enslaved as punishment for their pride in their great cities, Other beliefs are less appreciated by the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a>- such as the tales that some day the Chevs will be delivered from their bondage and rise to rule all space- but the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> are willing to take the bad with the good. Further, a number of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> masters have discovered offworld markets for the more impressive Chev artistic works. Some <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> have even managed to sell Chev theater troupes at \"Group Rates.\" <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Unlike many other slave populations, the Chevs are well educated and as informed about the galaxy at large as their <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> masters, perhaps even more so. <\/p>\n <p>The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> have always taken relatively good care of the Chevs because they believe healthy, bright, and happy slaves are more efficient than starved, illiterate and rebellious ones. The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> pass virtually every bit of knowledge they gain about the galaxy at large, including technology- with the exception of repulsorlifts, comlinks, and weaponry- to their slaves. <\/p>\n <p>One drawback to the Chevin's permissive attitudes toward Chev culture, at least from the point of view of oppressive slave masters, is that they remain unaware of high-tech rebel movements within Chev villages. Like the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a>, the Chevs take quickly to advanced technology and secretly build communications devices, jamming devices, sensors and weapons from parts stolen from farming equipment or <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> communities. Although the seeds of rebellion are first planted during the time of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic\" title=\"The Galactic Republic\">The Galactic Republic<\/a>, it isn't until <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era\" title=\"The New Jedi Order Era\">The New Jedi Order Era<\/a> that organized offworlders begin helping the Chevs expand their network of rebels. <\/p>\n <p>All Chevs encountered off <a class=\"new\" title=\"Vinsoth (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVmluc290aD9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Vinsoth<\/a> are either current or former slaves. When the Republic contacted the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a>, they almost instantly started exporting their slave population, either to other slavers or to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> colonies offworld. Most Chevs prefer to remain low-key and avoid political entanglements for fear of being recaptured by wandering <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a>. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chev_Characteristics\">Chev Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> The Chevs are not a broken people, despite their apparent subservience to the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a>.

Edition Unknown Regions<\/a><\/i> <\/p>\n <p><i>See also: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ebruchi_Fleet\" title=\"The Ebruchi Fleet\">The Ebruchi Fleet<\/a><\/i> <\/p>\n <p>The Ebruchi are cruel, ill-mannered pirates who plague the hyperlanes between Republic-settled space and the Chiss Ascendancy. To some, the Ebruchi are a terror. To militarily superior forces, such as the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chiss\" title=\"Chiss\">Chiss<\/a> and the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vagaari\" title=\"Vagaari\">Vagaari<\/a>, the Ebruchi are a perpetual annoyance. <\/p>\n <p>The Ebruchi are omnivorous. They can survive on rotting garbage if necessary, but their appetites lean toward the sadistic. They love nothing more than swallowing the wet flesh of freshly killed prisoners. Their compact bulk makes them appear formidable despite their shorter than-average height, and the muscles are not just for show. An Ebruchi can take a terrific pounding, then return the favor.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Ebruchi style of dress matches their stereotype as uncivilized, opportunistic pirates. A typical outfit consists of layers of animal skins topped with shiny medallions, rings, or crowns. But those who think that an Ebruchi's appearance is lazily haphazard are mistaken. The Ebruchi put great thought into the placement of each item and layer, and all clothing is tended with exquisite care. Patches, scarves, necklaces, and intentional holes and tears are all signs of rank and achievement, although the nuances of the arrangements are lost on non-Ebruchi. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ebruchi_Characteristics\">Ebruchi Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> The Ebruchi are driven by the basest of emotions: greed and fear. Unwilling to give an edge to any other being-including members of their own Species-they overcompensate to the point of overkill. If a ship shows a hint of aggression, they will blast it to fragments; if a subordinate challenges their rank, they will retaliate with deadly force. <\/p>\n <p>Still, the Ebruchi are not foolish, and they take such drastic actions only if they believe themselves to be safe from retaliation. This tendency, of course, makes them bullies of the worst stripe. The Ebruchi show no kindness unless they gain something in the process. They spare the lives of colonists only if the weaker beings provide tribute or possess some value as slaves or meat. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> The Ebruchi has a roughly humanoid configuration, with a squat, lumpy build similar to that of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gands\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gands\">Gands<\/a>. Their grayish heads house two wide-set eyes that never blink and a hidden mouth ringed by writhing, fleshy feelers. These tentacles are always in motion as they sample airborne scents and can grasp chunks of food to force them down the Ebruchi's narrow gullet. This process is messy and, to most <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, revolting. <\/p>\n <p>Male and female Ebruchi are nearly identical in appearance. Outsiders can distinguish them only because males and females usually wear different types of animal skins (Although determining the species of animal from it's fur is exceedingly difficult). It is best to employ gender-neutral pronouns when negotiating with the Ebruchi, for a mistaken identification of sex will be taken as a scandalous insult. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Ebruchi age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-7 Years <\/td> \n    <td>8-13 Years <\/td> \n    <td>14-39 Years <\/td> \n    <td>40-54 Years <\/td> \n    <td>55-64 Years <\/td> \n    <td>65+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> The Ebruchi are ignorant of their origins.

humanoids. As a Species, they are methodical researchers, careful observers, and considered among the best theoretical thinkers in the galaxy. Although well-versed in virtually every widely used technology in the galaxy, and often numbered among scientists who are on the cutting edge in a number of fields. Drall are primarily interested in abstract concepts and accumulating knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Therefore, despite the advanced nature of their scholarly pursuits, the world of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Drall (Planet) (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvRHJhbGxfKFBsYW5ldCk/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Drall<\/a> trails behind the rest of the galaxy in technological achievement, and the Drall themselves usually implement technology developed by others. For example, despite their having been part of the galactic community for over twenty millennia, the Drall still rely exclusively on spacefaring technology built by the Corellians.<\/p>\n <p>Drall society is a clan-based combination of a matriarch and a meritocracy. No elected or direct hereditary leaders exist on the Drall homeworld. Instead, each family heeds a \"Duchess,\" a female Drall who is deemed the most fit to lead. Once appointed, the Dutchess becomes the owner of all the family's property, and she holds the position for life or until she steps down and passes the title and property along to a suitable heir. Most of the Drall clans follow the overall direction set by the Dutchess of the most prosperous and powerful of all the clans. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Family life is also the most commonly discussed topic among Drall- exchanging gossip about one's family is a perfectly acceptable form of small talk. Drall find it surprising that other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> may consider probing questions about family affairs an invasion of privacy, although once this is spelled out to them they quickly take steps to avoid offense. <\/p>\n <p>Most Drall who venture from their homeworld work for megacorporations as researchers or medical specialists- one of Drall's main exports, aside from scientific knowledge, is processed medicinal herbs- although a few also make good livings as information brokers. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drall_Characteristics\">Drall Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Drall take pride in being viewed as well mannered and considerate. They are also intelligent, reasonable, and difficult to anger.

They expect others to behave in a similar fashion. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Drall have short muzzles and almond-shaped black eyes. Their bodies are covered in fur that ranges from brown and black to reddish-gray. They have short limbs and clawed hands and feet.

They evolved from a birdlike species yet are incapable of flight. <\/p>\n <p>The Ayrou were one of the first sentient Species in the Moddell Sector to master space flight. They have a baffling cultural paradigma that lets distinguished members of the Species debate a cultural or religious topic for generations, then abruptly commit to a single sociological custom or path. The Ayrou also possess a hoarding instinct that compels them to gather up anything they can find on the off chance that it can be used in the future.

The Ayrou are an attractive Species, with milky white skin and long, lean limbs. Ayrou have flat facial features, with wide-spaced eyes that are typically ruby red, sapphire blue, or emerald green. Instead of hair, Ayrou have a beautiful plumage of feathers in a dazzling array of colors. An Ayrou's plumage reflects his or her health, social status, and attractiveness. Consequently, Ayrou are constantly preening and checking their appearance. Ayrou have four tapered fingers on each hand and are triple-jointed, allowing them to bend their limbs at incredible angles. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Ayrou age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-7 Years <\/td> \n    <td>8-12 Years <\/td> \n    <td>13-44 Years <\/td> \n    <td>45-55 Years <\/td> \n    <td>56-79 Years <\/td> \n    <td>80+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Maya_Kovel\" title=\"Maya Kovel\">Maya Kovel<\/a>, a windswept Outer Rim world with a thin, acrid atmosphere. <\/p>\n <p><b>Languages:<\/b> Ayrou speak and read Ayrou.

Naturally, few other beings outside the remnants of the Empire agree with the Woostoid outlook on this matter. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"_Woostoid_Characteristics\">&nbsp;Woostoid Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Woostoids are a peaceful Species in the extreme- they find even the concept of warfare frightening. Their minds work in such a way that they always think of situations in an orderly manner, trying to create logical ties between events.

They have large, bulbous black eyes that rarely blink. Traditionally, they wear long flowing robes of shiny, bright-colored materials.

Though <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Felucia\" title=\"Felucia\">Felucia<\/a> has long been colonized, the native Felucians avoided notice by living deep in the jungle.

title=\"Farrfin\">Farrfin<\/a>. The Farghul are very conscious of their appearance and they are never seen in public without the highest quality of clothing they can afford, not to mention the latest fashions. When visiting other worlds, they always consult clothing stores so they can be properly attired. When on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farrfin\" title=\"Farrfin\">Farrfin<\/a>, they usually wear elaborately decorated cloaks, skirts, or pants; tunics, shirts, and blouses are not part of traditional Farghul dress. Elaborate jewelry, however, is essential. <\/p>\n <p>The Farghul prefer to rely on cunning and trickery rather than direct confrontation and force. Something has gone wrong somewhere along the way if a Farghul ends up in a fight, and it takes a lot of provocation to cause one to lose his or her good humor.

When the Jedi Council spearheaded a Republic-sponsored effort to clean out a number of smuggling and pirate bases that were choking trade in surrounding star systems, the display of force rocked Farghul culture to its core and left a deep scar on the collective psyche of the playful beings.

Following the fall of the Empire, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farrfin\" title=\"Farrfin\">Farrfin<\/a> joined the New Republic, but the world almost instantly became a hotbed of corruption and petty confidence schemes. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Farghul_Characteristics\">Farghul Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> The Farghul in general have playful and mischievous personalities.

These tenets include the concepts that outsiders are likely to taint Nazzar culture, that all philosophic systems in disagreement with Ulizra must be destroyed, and that a group is always of greater importance than an individual. These beliefs make it difficult for other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> to open trade relations with the Nazzar, or even for the Nazzar to retain cordial relations with most other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>.

Guide<\/a><\/i> <\/p>\n <p>The Weequay are well-known throughout the galaxy for their violent tendencies and lack of individuality. Deeply spiritual, they worship a broad pantheon of deities, the most senior of which is known as Quay. Zealous Weequay perform ritual sacrifices in Quay's honor, at times resorting to murder. Such incidents have done little to dispel their violent reputation. <\/p>\n <p>Each Weequay carries a spherical totem through which Quay allegedly speaks. The totem is used in times of great need to guide the Weequay, providing spiritual answers to individual questions. In practice, the Weequay asks a question, shakes the device, and waits for the answer to appear. A Weequay treats the totem's advice seriously and becomes angry and violent if such advice is questioned or ridiculed. <\/p>\n <p>Male Weequay ply the galaxy as thugs, mercenaries, and hired assassins, while female Weequay rarely, if ever, leave <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sriluur\" title=\"Sriluur\">Sriluur<\/a>. A Male Weequay who leaves Sriluur grows and cultivates a long braid, which is then shorn off upon his return to the homeworld in celebration. Weequay who are born off-world or adopted into other societies at an early age often develop more individualistic personalities than their deep-rooted cousins. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weequay_Characteristics\">Weequay Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Weequay are bullying, brooding, and superstitious by nature, Their culture does not assign names to individuals, as all Weequay are considered to be part of the same whole. They maintain a sinister silence, refusing to speak in the presence of non-Weequay, preferring instead to use trusted intermediaries to do their talking for them. Those raised apart from traditional values find their own voices and seldom integrate well back into Weequay society. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Weequay are humanoids with thick, leathery skin that ranges in color from tan to dark brown. Their faces are lipless, with flat noses and a well-defined frill along each of their jowls.

The Trade Federation is shattered, and Neimoidians see the wealth and galactic authority they accumulated over centuries evaporate within a few short years. <\/p>\n <p>Neimoidian leaders then make the decision to ally with the Separatist movement led by renegade Jedi Count Dooku, which results in the complete dismantling of everything they had built beyond their home systems. For the entire period of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire\" title=\"The Galactic Empire\">The Galactic Empire<\/a>, Neimoidian starports are under heavy Imperial control, and any efforts they make to reestablish their once-mighty trade networks are undermined at every turn. <\/p>\n <p>As a result, Neimoidian society turns inward in a self-imposed isolation that is as total as any they experienced during the millennia they spent as a \"Lost Duros Colony.\" The Neimoidians remain isolationists through <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legacy_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Legacy Era\">The Legacy Era<\/a>, and the few Neimoidians that wander beyond their home space are usually on the run from enemies at home and passing themselves off as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Duros\" title=\"Duros\">Duros<\/a>. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Neimoidian_Characteristics\">Neimoidian Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Neimoidians are greedy and cowardly, always striving to acquire just one more credit but trying to make sure that someone else takes whatever risks are associated with getting it. Any agreements or promises they make are always full of loopholes and caveats, since Neimoidians never want to suffer the embarrassment of a bad deal or risk being unable to predict every eventuality. Neimoidians want to appear cunning and as if they are the intellectual masters of every situation they encounter, but they typically are just conniving and devious. <\/p>\n <p>Neimoidians hate manual labor and physical activity, viewing such actions as tasks for underlings. They are very fond of mechanical equipment that does work for them and they are enthralled by labor-saving devices of all kinds. Droids are especially popular among Neimoidians. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Neimoidians are slight of build and stand between 1.6 and 2 meters in height. They are hairless, with large red eyes and wide, lipless mouths. Their skin is usually bluish gray, but it can range in tone from very pale to almost black.

complex, peaceful society.<\/p>\n <p>Kushibans have little need for tools or technology on their homeworld, where they manage to live in almost complete harmony with their natural environment. Although preyed upon by large predators, Kushibans typically use fire to keep them at bay. As herbivores, they do not need tools for hunting or preparing food. As they eat most of their food uncooked, they have little use for cooking utensils or similar items. When Kushibans need shelter from the elements, simple caves or tree hollows suffice. Consequently, Kushibans have little value to a spacefaring economy, and little desire to leave their homeworld. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Kushibans have a unique method of expressing their feelings: Their normally white fur changes color with their emotional state.

Most weapons design firms have counted Baragwin among their employees since their founding. However, Baragwin can be found in any type of occupation, virtually anywhere in the galaxy. <\/p>\n <p>Despite their alien appearance, the Baragwin remained on good terms with the Empire through most of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Rebellion Era\">The Rebellion Era<\/a>. The Empire wanted to tap their extensive talent for designing weaponry, and the Baragwin appreciated the handsome sums of money they were paid by the Imperial military or by megacorporations with Imperial backing. It wasn't until Intelligence Director Isard released the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Krytos_Virus\" title=\"Krytos Virus\">Krytos Virus<\/a>- a deadly, artificially created <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disease\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Disease\">Disease<\/a> that targeted every <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> but baseline <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans<\/a>- during the New Republic's liberation of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a> that most Baragwin put their support behind the freedom fighters. The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disease\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Disease\">Disease<\/a> hit <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant's<\/a> Baragwin population particularly hard. <\/p>\n <p>The Baragwin have a fine sense of smell and can often identify a being's mood by its scent. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Baragwin_Characteristics\">Baragwin Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Baragwin personalities are as varied as <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans<\/a>. If anything, Baragwin are underestimated due to their shuffling gait and ponderous way of carrying themselves. They are, in fact, highly intelligent but rarely take steps to correct the misperceptions ignorant beings may have about them- it often lets them identify potential foes. As beings with a highly malleable society, Baragwin tend to be open-minded and accepting of others who visit their communities. However, they are also quick to defend themselves and usually do so with great skill. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> The Baragwin are hunch-backed, humanoid saurians with massive heads nearly as wide as their shoulders and three digits on each massive hand. Their skin is tough, wrinkled, and ranges in color from drab green to dark olive. Their nostrils are broad and frequently seen to twitch.

Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p> The Kitonak are simple, primitive beings who have developed no technology beyond the most basic tools and have no written language. On their homeworld, they are organized into small tribes that survive by hunting migrating herds of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Chooba (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvQ2hvb2JhP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Chooba<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Kitonak society's most advanced achievement is music, which plays a central role in their culture. Young Kitonak are educated through epic songs that pass knowledge from generation to generation. <\/p>\n <p>Kitonak who are encountered off their homeworld are usually freed slaves. When the Species' homeworld was first discovered by scouts a few decades prior to the rise of the Empire, a number of enterprising slave traders thought the Kitonak's unique musical performances would make them interesting additions to the households of wealthy crime lords and shady senators. However, the unwillingness of the Kitonak to adhere to anyone's pace but their own (Even in the face of threats of violence and death) led to their execution, abandonment, or release. Some masters attempted to recoup the purchase price of their useless slaves by making the Kitonak pay for their freedom. Most of these Kitonak found work as musicians, and the merging of galactic popular music and the music of Kitonak society led to the rise of several innovative music styles during the turbulent Rebellion Era. <\/p>\n <p>A number of Kitonak were recruited as spies for <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance<\/a> during the Galactic Civil War. Their Species are almost tailor-made for the job: they come from a tradition of oral histories, so they have sharp memories, they do not get bored just observing and waiting for something to happen, and most non-Kitonak have a hard time telling whether a Kitonak is awake or asleep. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kitonak_Characteristics\">Kitonak Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b>&nbsp;Kitonak are beings of exceptional patience. They do everything with slow deliberation, including breathing and eating. Every decision is weighed with great care, even if it's something as trivial as which one of two seemingly identical packages of dried rations to purchase. They are so methodical and slow moving that many other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> become annoyed with them and attempt to rush them. When others try to rush them, Kitonak slow down even more out of protest. <\/p>\n <p>Kitonak have a well-deserved reputation for being insanely brave, once they get around to confronting danger. They are very steadfast in the face of any opposition. The only things they are truly afraid of are quicksand and caves- quicksand because it represents a slow and painful death for a Kitonak who only has to breathe every few hours, and caves because Kitonak legends claim they are gateways to the Realm of the Dead. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b>&nbsp;Kitonak are humanoids with sturdy legs and thick arms that end in pudgy fingers. Their eyes, ears, mouth, and other bodily orifices are all nearly invisible within the folds of their tough, leathery hides.

<p>The Gurlanin of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Qiilura\" title=\"Qiilura\">Qiilura<\/a> were content to live a fairly primitive lifestyle, happy in their simple lives. When Republic settlers came to their world to harvest barq, a delicacy, the Gurlanin were removed from some lands, and considered non-sentient pests by the mostly <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> settlers. When the Clone Wars began, the Separatists used the planet to house a biological weapons laboratory. Seeing an opportunity to make an ally that would help them reclaim their world, the Gurlanin allied with the Republic. Together, they were eventually able to remove not only the Separatists, but the Republic farmers as well.&nbsp; <\/p>\n <p>Gurlanin are marsupials, carrying their young in a pouch. They mate for life and are extremely loyal to their spouses. There is no known formal government amongst the Gurlanin, and each mated pair would seem to be considered a sovereign entity amongst fellow Gurlanin. The entire campaign against the Separatists and alliance with the Republic was engineered by a single pair of Gurlanin. When the brokered alliance looked as though it might fall apart, many other Gurlanin couples agreed to aid Jinart and Valaquil in potential reprisals, the threat of which caused the Republic to eventually keep its end of the bargain.&nbsp; <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gurlanin_Characteristics\">Gurlanin Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Gurlanin are largely considered mysterious and manipulative, and always dangerous.

Guide\">Star Wars Saga Edition Legacy Era Campaign Guide<\/a><\/i> <\/p>\n <p>The amphibious Chagrians are comfortable both on land and in water. The coastal cities of their homeworld are constructed to allow the rising tides to flood the buildings. When this takes place, Chagrians swim from place to place, or use speeders, which are adapted for aquatic use. The pleasant tropical climate of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Champala\" title=\"Champala\">Champala<\/a>, coupled with the exotic architecture of its cities makes the Chagrian homeworld a popular destination for galactic tourists. Unlike cities, spaceports on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Champala\" title=\"Champala\">Champala<\/a> are built high above sea level, on the dryest parcels of land.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Although juvenile Chagrians possess a weak sense of taste, this sense fades as they mature into adults. The end result is that Chagrians rarely, if ever, enjoy consuming food and drink, and do so solely to fuel their bodies. Dining activities are traditionally viewed as a nuisance, and a waste of time, so most Chagrians choose to consume nutrient capsules in order to maintain bodily health and energy levels. When traveling, most Chagrians carry portable scanners that allow them to determine the relative nutrient value of the food they eat. Although they are unable to taste the food they eat, Chagrians view dining as an opportunity to socialize with members of other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> that do not share their sensory deficiencies. <\/p>\n <p>Society on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Champala\" title=\"Champala\">Champala<\/a> is peaceful and highly structured, although Chagrian legal systems are complex and often daunting to outsiders. As a rule, Chagrians are law-abiding and obedient toward figures of authority. Chagrian government ensures that every citizen is cared for, and the standard of living for even the poorest Chagrian is quite high when compared to the impoverished members of other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p>Chagrians have inherited an innate resistance to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation\" title=\"Radiation\">Radiation<\/a> due to instability in Champala's primary star. Their blue skin is a direct result of this evolutionary step, and modern Chagrians continue to enjoy protection from myriad forms of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation\" title=\"Radiation\">Radiation<\/a> as a side effect. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chagrian_Characteristics\">Chagrian Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Chagrians are, by and large, even-tempered and accepting of others. They appreciate law, order, and well-defined social structures. On their homeworld, they want for little, and so Chagrians are rarely selfish or greedy individuals. Due to their accepting natures, Chagrians enjoy interacting with members of many different <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. Given their loyalty, they make excellent companions and friends. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Chagrians possess thick skin that ranges in color from light blue to dark indigo. Horns (Known as <i>Lethorns<\/i>) stem from a pair of fleshy growths that protrude from the sides of their heads.

Their ancestors' fins and flukes have been replaced by arms and legs, although Herglics still breathe through blowholes on the tops of their heads. <\/p>\n <p>As a whole, Herglics are great believers in fairness and honesty. They are renowned for always being upright traders and for honoring any deal or bargain they make. They assume that others behave in a similar fashion, and few things anger a Herglic more than deceit and cheating. <\/p>\n <p>Herglics are risk-takers, both by nature and by ancient cultural tradition. They love meeting new beings and experiencing the sights and sounds of new places. They develop space travel independently of other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, and it is Herglic exploration that helps the Old Republic spread through the stars as quickly as it does. <a class=\"new\" title=\"Giju (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvR2lqdT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Giju<\/a> is among the first worlds in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic\" title=\"The Old Republic\">The Old Republic<\/a>, and the Herglics often establish trading posts in colonies just for the excitement of visiting exotic locales.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Herglic mercantile networks are a vital part of the galactic economy for thousands of years, and these networks stand loyally with the Republic during its greatest challenges because the Herglics support the fairness and justice they see in the galactic government. However, Herglics become increasingly marginalized as decadence, corruption, and greed take hold of the galactic government at virtually every level. <\/p>\n <p>Many consider the Herglics to be cowards and traitors to the people of the galaxy, and they are viewed with contempt in many quarters even a century after the fall of Emperor Palpatine. But the Herglics are happy to be in a position to help devastated worlds rebuild by supplying them with high quality goods at fair prices. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Herglic_Characteristics\">Herglic Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Herglics are so easy-going and gregarious that they drive more high-strung beings, such as the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ubese\" title=\"Ubese\">Ubese<\/a>, to distraction. Herglics love interacting and socializing with others, and they are often very generous when it comes to sharing wealth and good fortune. Anyone in need usually finds his or her Herglic friends among the first to offer assistance. Their helpful nature causes many Herglics to fall victim to petty con artists, but professional criminals know that when a Herglic feels betrayed, he or she will go to great lengths to take revenge. More than one small-time swindler has been stalked by top bounty hunters after taking advantage of the wrong Herglic. <\/p>\n <p>Members of the Species also crave excitement-in fact, many Herglics become addicted to thrill seeking. This often manifests as a tendency to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gamble\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gamble\">Gamble<\/a> to excess; only a strong-willed Herglic can pass up a game of chance. Once they start to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gamble\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gamble\">Gamble<\/a>, they do not stop unless forced to quit, and a Herglic can easily lose everything- including the clothes off his or her back- in a short time by betting in the wrong casinos. For this reason, all forms of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gambling\" title=\"Gambling\">Gambling<\/a> are outlawed or heavily regulated on worlds with large Herglic populations. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Adult Herglics stand between 1.7 and 2.2 meters in height, and their heavily muscled bodies are very wide for their height. In fact, Herglics are so large that they cannot fit through doorways or corridors built with less massive beings in mind. Virtually all ships piloted by Herglics are either specially constructed or extensively modified at shipyards operated by their Species. <\/p>\n <p>Herglic bodies are hairless, and their skin ranges from a deep blue-gray to a black that is darker than the depths of space. Some Herglics have white bellies or white stripes that run up the sides of their bodies and terminate at their large, heavily lidded eyes. Herglic eyes are nearly universally black in color, although some rare individuals might have blue or red eyes. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Herglics age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-15 Years <\/td> \n    <td>16-19 Years <\/td> \n    <td>20-55 Years <\/td> \n    <td>56-79 Years <\/td> \n    <td>80-95 Years <\/td> \n    <td>96+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> Herglics originate on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Colonies\" title=\"The Colonies\">The Colonies<\/a> region world of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Giju (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvR2lqdT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Giju<\/a>, a planet known for its deep oceans and lush islands. <\/p>\n <p><b>Languages:<\/b> All Herglics know Basic and Herglic.

Wikia user Lukewarner (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>The Ranth are predatory hunters who dwell on the frigid dark side of a tidally locked world, where the planet's two large moons provide the only natural illumination. The Ranth have learned to track time by studying the paths of these two satellites. <\/p>\n <p>Sometime in their distant past, the primitive Ranth split into two distinct societies. The first group formed permanent communities atop the planet's great drifting glaciers, slowly advancing toward a sophisticated industrial civilization with a formal government, an interest in galactic affairs, and cavernous ice cities displaying wondrous architecture. The second group remained nomadic and savage by comparison. Roaming in small tribes, these Ranth lack the technology of their more settled counterparts, relying on tireless beasts of burden and their keen predatory instincts to survive. For the most part, the Civilized Ranth and Nomadic Ranth avoid one another, as almost every encounter between the two ends in violence and bloodshed.<\/p>\n <p>Both Civilized and Nomadic Ranth maintain strong family ties, as each family carries forward it's own traditions, history, and set of values (Often dictated by the family's elder). Civilized Ranth have extensive contact with the rest of the galaxy, adapting to the latest trends. Nomadic Ranth war fur and leather garments made from the hides of slain beasts, tend to fear offworlders, and work to undermine the Civilized Ranth society. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Empire occupied the Ranth homeworld for a time. Imperial agents searching for secret Rebel bases encountered the Ranth instead. The Civilized Ranth accepted Imperial rule without a struggle, benefiting from the introduction of new technology and regarding the Empire as a symbol of great achievement and promise. The Nomadic Ranth were far less enamored with the Empire. They attacked Imperial patrols and mining stations before vanishing into the icy wastelands. Unable to track the Nomadic Ranth, the Imperials turned to the Civilized Ranth for assistance. The city-dwellers followed the directive without question, leading to many open conflicts among the Civilized and Nomadic Ranth. <\/p>\n <p>Imperial engineers changed the face of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Caaraz (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvQ2FhcmF6P2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Caaraz<\/a> with strip-mining, construction, and pollution. With the Empire's defeat, the Civilized Ranth took control of the abandoned Imperial mining installations and processing facilities. Since then, conditions on the planet have deteriorated. Mining facilities have become makeshift cities overpopulated with Ranth that had enjoyed unfettered protection from predators under Imperial rule. The resulting population explosion has left these Ranth impoverished. <\/p>\n <p>The Nomadic Ranth continue to mount attacks against Civilized Ranth communities. Meanwhile, the Civilized Ranth strive to push their primitive brethren deeper into the icy wastelands, where they can pose no threat. Neither society shows any sign of changing its ways. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ranth_Characteristics\">Ranth Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Ranth have short tempers but rarely hold grudges.

They love to play games and solve convoluted puzzles, and they watch just about every sport in the galaxy. Highly competitive, they prefer a challenge to \"An Easy Kill\" (A common Krish metaphor for any sort of mismatch). For instance, a Krish bounty hunter will give weak quarry every conceivable advantage to keep the hunt challenging. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Krish_Characteristics\">Krish Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b>&nbsp;Krish are cunning, fearless, unscrupulous, and easily goaded.

Wikia user Lukewarner (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>The fierce Sludir evolved from a primitive tribal society to an intricate feudal caste society or rulers, warriors, artisans, and workers. In addition to learning the traditions and ways of their particular caste-clans, Sludir children were taught to respect the code of battle. Combat became the true test of a Sludir's character. Hiding and retreating were the tactics of a coward; a Sludir who resorted to such tactics would not only dishonor themselves, but their clan as well.<\/p>\n <p>Sludir civilization remained unchallenged until a few years before the Galactic Civil War, when offworld slavers began capturing bands of Sludir warriors and selling them as gladiators. When Imperial scouts arrived on the Sludir homeworld, slavery had already weakened the Sludir caste structure. The Empire declared the Sludir a \"Legitimate Slave Species\" and destroyed the remnants of their intricate feudal caste society by exporting Sludir warriors, artisans, and workers to Imperial work camps throughout the galaxy. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>A handful of enslaved Sludir escaped their captors and joined <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance<\/a>. Many more joined criminal organizations, where their physical prowess made them excellent enforcers, pirates, bodyguards, and (Ironically) slavers. Regardless of allegiance, most Sludir resorted to violence and conflict to attain higher standing in whatever organization or society that would accept them. <\/p>\n <p>The Sludir regained control of their homeworld after the Empire's fall. A new planetary government emerged, made up of a loose alliance of shady Sludir of varying dispositions, from genteel smugglers to vicious crime lords. Many liberated Sludir slaves returned to their homeworld, hoping to reunite with their clans or find others who respected their code of battle honor. Those appalled with the new state of the Sludir homeworld drifted to various corners of the galaxy in search of status, glory, or death by combat. <\/p>\n <p>Although they are not technophobic, Sludir seldom embrace advanced technologies such as space travel and blasters, preferring hand-to-hand combat and intimidation to settle disputes. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sludir_Characteristics\">Sludir Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Sludir are direct and blunt.

Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>Temolaks are brawny yet timid galactic scavengers who scour the galaxy in search of derelict vessels and other detritus that can be rebuilt or recast into useful gear and sold to underdeveloped worlds. Members of the Species seldom interact with technologically advanced societies; Temolaks prefer to deal with primitives who value the relatively low-tech amenities they can provide.<\/p>\n <p>Temolak salvagers patrol the galaxy in cramped transports built from scrap. A Temolak salvage crew considers a derelict Starship a treasure trove, stripping the vessel of everything right down to the wires and deck plates. Although generally nonviolent, Temolaks fiercely defend their salvage rights and protect their own interests, and many space pirates know better than to challenge a Temolak salvage crew for ownership of a drifting space hulk of questionable worth. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Temolaks often \"Colonize\" abandoned <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Stations\" title=\"Space Stations\">Space Stations<\/a>, using these ramshackle facilities as trading outposts and warehouses. Spacefaring Temolaks rarely return to their backwater homeworld except to sell their wares. <\/p>\n <p>In the days of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic\" title=\"The Old Republic\">The Old Republic<\/a>, competition among Temolak salvage crews sometimes led to bloody conflict. These skirmishes were clearly counterproductive and heralded the formation of the Temolak Salvage Consortium. The TSC assigned a territory to each salvage crew, thereby eliminating competition. When the Empire took power, many Temolaks left the consortium and retreated to the farthest corners of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim\" title=\"The Outer Rim\">The Outer Rim<\/a>, hoping to sidestep strict Imperial salvage laws imposed on the TSC. Several of these crews did remarkably well for themselves, while others simply perished. <\/p>\n <p>Over the millenia, Temolaks have evolved redundant internal organs (An extra heart, and extra liver, an extra set of lungs, and a third kidney) to help them survive the rigors of their homeworld and life among the stars. As they have evolved physically, so too have the Temolaks advanced technologically. Two thousand years before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, when their homeworld's water supply evaporated, the Temolaks built orbital ships capable of extracting water from the world's icy rings. Since then, they have built their own sublight drives and acquired Hyperspace technology. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Temolak_Characteristics\">Temolak Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> In spite of their brutish appearance, Temolaks are crafty, timid scavengers. Quiet and unassuming, they don't call too much attention to their activities.

Living among the stars has taught them how to subsist on the scraps left behind by other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, and they are known for turning bits of useless garbage into practical tools. Although resourceful, they are easily swayed and far too trusting of strangers. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Temolaks are muscular, heavy-set humanoids with clay-colored skin, scrunched faces, fanlike ridges along the chin, and small curved horns protruding from the cheekbones.

Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>A Species of galactic nomads who only interact with others of their kind to mate, Rybets claim to have evolved on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Varl\" title=\"Varl\">Varl<\/a>, the now devastated- some say legendary- homeworld of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutt\" title=\"Hutt\">Hutts<\/a>. Despite this proclamation, the Species' planet of origin remains uncertain. Much of the Species' history was lost during the Clone Wars, but the Rybets claim that a war between their Species and the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutt\" title=\"Hutt\">Hutts<\/a> nearly destroyed <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Varl\" title=\"Varl\">Varl<\/a> and that, given time, the Rybets will rise again to destroy their old enemies (A threat that amuses the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hutts\">Hutts<\/a>). The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutt\" title=\"Hutt\">Hutts<\/a> hold fast to their beliefs that they were the sole beings to survive the mysterious destruction that was visited upon the Ardos System long before the dawn of recorded history. Most scholars side with the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutt\" title=\"Hutt\">Hutts<\/a>, although no one can offer a better explanation for the origin of the Rybets. Whatever the truth, strong hatred exists between Rybets and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics\" title=\"The Hutt Kajidics\">The Hutt Kajidics<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p> Rybets are encountered along heavily traveled space lanes in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim\" title=\"The Mid Rim\">The Mid Rim<\/a> and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim_Territories\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Outer Rim Territories\">The Outer Rim Territories<\/a>. They shun planet life, preferring to live aboard Starships, orbital facilities, or starports. A few works as transport pilot, Starship mechanics, and spaceport engineers; many earn a living by operating tramp freighters and hauling small cargoes and contraband. Rybets have a knack for ending up on the wrong side of the law and experienced spacefarers who rely on privately owned ships for travel hesitate to travel on Rybet operated freighters and transports for the risk of never reaching their destination is too great. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Xenobiologists estimate that fewer than one billion Rybets live in the galaxy. Some attribute the Species' relative scarcity on their solitary nature and the lack of any established Rybet settlement. Also to blame is the Species' gender opposition: Rybet males inexplicably detest Rybet females. (The reverse is true of the female of the Species.) Only an overwhelming compulsion to reproduce can overcome the males, fear and loathing of Rybet females. Rybets feel a drive to reproduce every 10 years of their adult lives. <\/p>\n <p>Females lay a clutch of between three and eight eggs. A Rybet couple stays together for a year or two, typically slaving their ships together and each taking part in the early rearing of the children. Eventually, however, they start to grate on each other's nerves: if the male doesn't leave of his own accord, he often ends up dead or maimed. Rybet children mature swiftly. By the age of five, they are ready to attempt to make their way in the galaxy. A Rybet mother who slays the father typically sells his ship, giving her young the proceeds with which to start their lives. If not, they must figure out how to make it on their own after their mother tosses them off her ship. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rybet_Characteristics\">Rybet Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b>&nbsp;Rybets are sly, astute, impertinent opportunists. They are well adapted for life in space, prefer a nomadic lifestyle, and would rather live in a Starship's gloomy cargo hold than the most opulent palace on any world. They don't like to stay in one place for long, and their grasp of morals and ethics is questionable at best. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b>&nbsp;The Rybets are short, squat humanoids with rough-textured green skin and four long fingers and tees that end in vestigial suction cups. Skin colors range from bright green to deep olive, with faint ochre stripes along their cheeks. Their eyes are bulbous and lantern-like, with upper and lower eyelids that close across the center of the eye. Adult males stand between 1.2 and 1.5 meters tall, while females stand between 1.5 and 1.9 meters tall. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Rybets age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-5 Years <\/td> \n    <td>6-9 Years <\/td> \n    <td>10-40 Years <\/td> \n    <td>41-60 Years <\/td> \n    <td>61-70 Years <\/td> \n    <td>71+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table>\n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> Rybets claim their Species originated on the planet <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Varl\" title=\"Varl\">Varl<\/a>, located in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim\" title=\"The Outer Rim\">The Outer Rim<\/a>.

(Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i><\/p>\n <p>Khommites are a Species of clones created from a race that stopped developing over a thousand years ago. At that time, the Khommites believed that their civilization had reached its apex, and no further improvement was possible. Rather than risk the degeneration of their supposedly perfect culture, they decided to ensure nothing ever changed. Cloning eventually replaced live births entirely. Since the existing balance of professions was considered ideal, each clone would take over the duties of its predecessor. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Absolute conformity resulted. Cities were laid out on grids, and buildings were built in boxlike shapes. If something began to suffer the ravages of wear and tear, it was replaced with a perfect replica. Creativity and free thought became undesirable, and eventually foreign. <\/p>\n <p>The highly organized way of life on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Khomm\" title=\"Khomm\">Khomm<\/a> changed when a Khommite named Dorsk 81 discovered they were capable of sensing <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a>. When they left their world to study at Master Skywalker's academy, other Khommites considered them a borderline lunatic. They fully expected them to eventually return to their old duties, but Dorsk 81 had other plans. The Khommite homeworld was later attacked by a fleet of powerful Imperial ships and suffered massive destruction. After such a powerful blow to their carefully ordered society, many Khommites reconsidered the benefits of pure conformity without innovation. Since then, a few have left <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Khomm\" title=\"Khomm\">Khomm<\/a> to follow the example of Dorsk 81. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"_Khommite_Characteristics\">&nbsp;Khommite Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Among Khommites, conformity is more important than creativity.

class=\"mw-parser-output\">\n <p><i>Pantoran Species data created by Wikia user Darthauthor.<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>These blue-skinned <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Humans\" title=\"Near-Humans\">Near-Humans<\/a> come from a cold climate and were vibrant participants in galactic society during the time of the Republic. In the time of the Galactic Civil War, the democratic and politically active Pantorans have found themselves in a precarious position in galactic politics, one rife with disaster but also promise. <\/p>\n <p>Fiercely independent believers in freedom and democracy, Pantorans still have small cultural holdovers from a more feudal era. Pantorans wear yellow marks on their foreheads, under their eyes, and on their cheeks to denote their family names and lineages. Most Pantorans have a general interest in genealogy and history, and enjoy spending time searching for long-lost relatives and connections to ancient heroes and historical figures. A few Pantorans still hold noble titles. Some also wear headgear and jewelry proudly denoting birthplaces and associated famous geographic regions where ancient Pantoran battles, treaties, artistic works, and the like occured. However, in this current age, Pantorans have turned global politics and debate into an art form in the spirit of democracy.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Bitter and heated arguments rage across Pantoran society regarding the fate of their homeworld. When <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic\" title=\"The Galactic Republic\">The Galactic Republic<\/a> fell and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire\" title=\"The Galactic Empire\">The Galactic Empire<\/a> ascended, Pantorans became deeply uncertain about their relationship with the galaxy. In both their Democratic Assembly and public squares, three different camps have formed regarding Pantora's political future. One camp- the appeasers- considers integration with the Empire a pragmatic goal. With the Empire's recognition, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pantora\" title=\"Pantora\">Pantora<\/a> would gain security both militarily and economically. Another camp insists on maintaining the ideals of the Republic. These traditionalists, or republicans, consider the Empire a betrayer of those ideals, although many also believe that the Rebels cannot truly restore the Republic. A growing few believe that <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pantora\" title=\"Pantora\">Pantora<\/a> needs to strike out on its own, to found new colonies and exploit new resources. These expansionists believe that they need to forge treaties with the nearby slavers and spice traders, but enough Pantorans see that direction as abhorrent that any such bill dies on the Assembly floor. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pantoran_Characteristics\">Pantoran Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> As members of a society struggling with galactic isolation for the last two decades Pantorans are open to new ideas, both good and bad.

Their hair ranges in color from black and blue to light purple and white. They have an average height similar to that of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans<\/a>, a bit less than two meters. Their physiology allows them to be comfortable in lower temperatures, requiring only a couple layers of casual clothing in icy climates.

They line their earthen homes with wood chips, leaves, and other natural materials that serve to keep them warm and dry.

href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a> as laborers and hired muscle. Their reproductive rates can get out of hand rapidly, ruining entire ecosystems beyond hope of restoration. <\/p>\n <p>A Lugubraa lacks eyes and is blind to visual light, but surrounding its mouth are numerous heat spots that detect thermal signatures as well as echolocation pingers that can paint a radar map of the surroundings. A Lugubraa has no ears, instead detecting sounds through vibrations sensed along the length of its skin, which is smooth and thick like that of an oceanic cetacean. Skin coloration varies between white and dark gray, but most Lugubraa are so pale that they trigger unpleasant mental associations with grubs and maggots.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>From birth to six months, Lugubraa have the self-awareness of domesticated beasts, able to follow simple commands and steadfastly devoted to their horde or the owner that has purchased their services. After six months, their intelligence reaches that of simple-minded sentients, allowing them to communicate in short sentences but still rendering them hopeless when it comes to advanced calculations. <\/p>\n <p>It is rare for Lugubraa to survive more than a few decades, but those that do undergo a second cognitive kick-start at approximately age 50. These unusual geniuses become leaders and strategists for the Lugubraa hordes, plotting ways to acquire more resources and brokering the services of their species as mercenaries to interested galactic parties. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lugubraa_Characteristics\">Lugubraa Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Appetite drives the Lugubraa. Their churning mouths connect to gullets that never seem satisfied.

A Lugubraa's body is a sleek tube that tapers into a short tail. The creature's face is dominated by a circular mouth, with rings of teeth that mesh in gearlike patterns for chewing, making it nearly impossible for prey to pull free once a hungry Lugubraa has latched on. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Lugubraa age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-9 Years <\/td> \n    <td>10-19 Years <\/td> \n    <td>20-99 Years <\/td> \n    <td>100-134 Years <\/td> \n    <td>135-149 Years <\/td> \n    <td>150+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b>&nbsp;The Lugubraa originate from deep space, in a vast corridor of dust and ice asteroids that the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tchuukthai\" title=\"Tchuukthai\">Tchuukthai<\/a> call the Stratos Distribution. This unique astrophysical environment harbors predatory lightning-jacks, membranous stillsails more than 100,000 kilometers across, and forests of crystalline cometary fronds. The roots of the Lugubraa evolutionary tree can still be found here, with worm like chewers carving warrens inside mineral-rich rocks. <\/p>\n <p><b>Languages:<\/b> Lugubraa communicate through their own language of Lugubraal, a tongue of groans and moans that few other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> can replicate.

user Droidscotty (Converted from its Aliens Stats counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>One of the few sapient Species in the galaxy that evolved from plant-based organisms, The Ergesh of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Expansion_Region\" title=\"The Expansion Region\">The Expansion Region<\/a> planet <a class=\"new\" title=\"Ergeshui (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvRXJnZXNodWk/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Ergeshui<\/a> resemble mounds of plant material with a variety of appendages. Ergesh do not have faces in the accepted sense of the word. A number of the smaller tentacles actually optic stalks, the Ergesh equivalent of eyes, while others are sensitive to sound waves. <\/p>\n <p>When Ergesh get angry, they quake and begin to make gargling noises. They are poor combatants, their most effective attack is to simply trample over their opponents. Due to their massive bulk (An adult Ergesh weighs half a metric ton), this crude tactic is extremely effective against foes <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a>-sized and smaller. The major drawback of this attack is that the Ergesh must be close to their opponent to begin with, as they are not swift enough to catch a fleeing foe. <\/p>\n <p>Once per year, there comes a day when both moons are aligned in a certain way, with devastating effects on the Ergesh. During this period, the Ergesh act irrational, violent, even insane. It is almost as if the Ergesh are intoxicated. This day is called he \"Bad Water Pull,\" and all offworlders are encouraged to stay clear of the native population until the madness passes. <\/p>\n <p>Ergesh are divided into clans, which have formed a federation that rules the planet. The eldest Ergesh from each clan is part of the governing body. This government meets monthly in the Communal Pool. The Ergesh federation has ties with <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance<\/a>, and occasionally harbors Rebel fugitives. <\/p>\n <p>The Ergesh specialize in organic machines, most of them \"Grown\" in the area called the \"Industrial Swampfields.\" Ergesh machinery is a fusion of plant matter and manufactured materials. This equipment cannot be deprived of moisture for more than one standard hour, or it ceases to function properly. Even Ergesh buildings are organic, and some are semi-sentient. No locks are needed on the dilating doors because the buildings know who they belong to. Ergesh buildings have ramps instead of stairs- indeed, stairs are unheard of, and there is no such word in the native language. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ergesh_Characteristics\">Ergesh Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Ergesh are boisterous, curious, and rather naive. They are social beings, greatly prizing friends and \"Family.\" Despite their fearsome appearance, they are not violent. Unfortunately, Ergesh have yet to become accustomed to all of the diverse <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> of the galaxy. To Ergesh, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans<\/a> are an \"Unfathomable Alien Species.\" In their dealings with one another, Ergesh are honest and fair. Theirs is a society with no classes, no discrimination, and no wants. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> The average Ergesh stands two meters tall and resembles a rounded heap of moving plant matter. Its body is covered with drooping, slimy appendages that range from two centimeters to three meters in length, and from one millimeter to five centimeters in width. Ergesh coloration is a blend of green, brown, and gray. The younger Ergesh have more green, the elders more brown. A strong smell of ammonia and rotting vegetation follows an Ergesh wherever it goes. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b> Ergesh age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th><b>CHILD<\/b> <\/th> \n    <th><b>YOUNG ADULT<\/b> <\/th> \n    <th><b>ADULT<\/b> <\/th> \n    <th><b>MIDDLE AGE<\/b> <\/th> \n    <th><b>OLD<\/b> <\/th> \n    <th><b>VENERABLE<\/b> <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-10 Years <\/td> \n    <td>11-29 Years <\/td> \n    <td>30-129 Years <\/td> \n    <td>130-169 Years <\/td> \n    <td>170-199 Years <\/td> \n    <td>200+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> The Ergesh are native to <a class=\"new\" title=\"Ergeshui (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvRXJnZXNodWk/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Ergeshui<\/a>, an oppressively hot and humid world.

The sole settlement is Offworlder City, built more or less along conventional lines. <\/p>\n <p><b>Languages:<\/b> Ergesh communicate using sound-based speech. Their voices sound like thick mud coming to a rapid boil. In fact, many Ergesh- especially those that deal most with offworlders- speak rather good Basic, though it sounds as if the speaker is talking underwater. Due to how they perceive and understand the world around them, they often omit personal pronouns (I, Me) and articles (A, The). Most small words in the Ergesh tongue are represented by vocal inflections. <\/p>\n <p><b>Example Names:<\/b> Ergesh personal names are long affairs, with many odd bubbling noises included. The Ergesh tolerate being given nicknames by offworlders that they are dealing with. <\/p>\n <p><b>Adventurers:<\/b> Ergesh are not hesitant about traveling into space. They wear special belts that not only produce a nitrogen field that allows them to breathe, but also retains the vast majority of their moisture. The Ergesh travel in living spaceships called <i>Starjumpers<\/i>. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ergesh_Species_Traits\">Ergesh Species Traits<\/span><\/h3> \n <p>Ergesh share the following Species Traits: <\/p>  \n <ul>\n  <li><b>Breathe Underwater:<\/b> Due to their physiology, Ergesh can't drown in water, though they do \"Prefer\" dry land.<\/li> \n  <li><b>Natural Armor:<\/b> An Ergesh's thick, wet skin provides a +1 Natural Armor bonus to their <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Reflex Defense\">Reflex Defense<\/a>.

<a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sorcerers_of_Rhand\" title=\"The Sorcerers of Rhand\">The Sorcerers of Rhand<\/a><\/i> <\/p>\n <p>The Sorcerers of Rhand live deep in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a>, hidden by the red flow of the Perann Nebula from any disciples of The Dark who wish to tap their knowledge. Their reclusiveness is a blessing, for if the Sorcerers of Rhand were to unleash the full entropic power of what they call The Dark, the entire galaxy might come to ruin. <\/p>\n <p>The Sorcerers or Rhand are realists. They understand that the power of destruction, coupled with time, has more ability to change the universe than any effort of creation. They devote their efforts to understanding its purpose and ultimately divining a way to become agents of The Dark. By manipulating the forces of destruction, they can bring their enemies to ruin. <\/p>\n <p>The Sorcerers do not care about the traditions of the Jedi and the Sith. The idea of a \"Force\" with a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Side\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Light Side\">Light Side<\/a> and a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dark Side\">Dark Side<\/a> strikes them as quaint and naïve. When they tap into The Dark, they are not communicating with an energy field created by living things (By definition, a fleeting, transitory trifle) but with the fundamental law of reality. <\/p>\n <p>According to Succate's annals, the Sorcerers are the culmination of three ancient philosophical schools. The first is the Knell of Muspilli, a death cult from the moon trees of the Gunninga Gap that transcribed the Taurannix Codex to call forth apocalyptic deities from beyond the Gap's spatial fissure.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The second school is the Kanzer Exiles, a fanatical flock of reptilians led by the Lord Ravager Korman Lao. These exiles expanded their faith through mental enslavement and built a world-sized temple near the Valtaullu Rift. <\/p>\n <p>The third school is an offshoot of the Warriors of the Shadow-Taung soldiers beaten by the Battalions of Zhell in the prehistory of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a>. After surviving the war and a volcanic plume of ash that filled the skies for two years, the priestly sisterhood of the Taungs fled to the Unknown Regions to seek atonement through meditation and insight. <\/p>\n <p>Thousands of years bring about the merging of these belief systems on the worlds of the Nihil Retreat near the Perann Nebula. Deep within the nebula itself, on the planet <a class=\"new\" title=\"Rhand (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvUmhhbmQ/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Rhand<\/a> that gives the new movement its name, the greatest Sorcerers take up residence in the dark ruins of a long-dead species. Outposts and monasteries on the twelve planets of the Nihil Retreat come to be populated by acolytes of the faith (Known as Rhandites), who have not yet attained true insight into The Dark. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sorcerer_of_Rhand_Characteristics\">Sorcerer of Rhand Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> An overriding faith in The Dark motivates the Sorcerers of Rhand. This concept, unrelated to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a> practiced by the Jedi and Sith, is interpreted to mean the ultimate end of all existence. Scientists refer to The Dark as the concept of entropy, and others brush against its meaning when they complain that \"Things fall apart.\" But the Sorcerers of Rhand believe that The Dark is everything, and therefore the only true source of power. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> The Sorcerers have no uniform appearance and are not presumed to be members of the same <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. Yet no one is clear on what, exactly, the Sorcerers of Rhand are. Succate, a chronicler from <a class=\"new\" title=\"Carrivar (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvQ2Fycml2YXI/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Carrivar<\/a>, assembled the largest collection of information on the Sorcerers of Rhand 80 years before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>. According to her recounting of a meeting in the central ruin of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Rhand (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvUmhhbmQ/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Rhand<\/a>, each Sorcerer manifests in a unique state of disassembly and decay. One lacked skin and oozed bodily fluids with every step. One was merely a blackened skeleton. Another appeared to have been turned inside out, with clean white teeth poking jaggedly from a raw mass of a head. A fourth existed as a long ribbon of flesh that swirled and coiled throughout the Rhandite receiving chamber. <\/p>\n <p>Succate could not determine whether these were mortal beings that had been transformed into such states, supernatural entities that had taken strange forms, or simply illusions. But despite their unsettling appearance, the presence of additional black-cloaked figures hovering on the periphery engendered even more dread- for Succate's imagination conjured even worse horrors that might lie beneath their black folds. <\/p>\n <p>Most Sorcerers of Rhand appear to walk on two legs, but some hover above the ground at a height of half a meter, the hems of their robes dangling above the cold stone. Others have four or more legs and scuttle close to the floor with heavy blankets draped over their backs. A few rare members of the order flap high above their gatherings on wings, unwilling or unable to descend to ground level. Meeting an assemblage of Sorcerers is a disorienting and sometimes terrifying experience. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Due to their varied origins and Force corruption, Sorcerers of Rhand are not affected by the effects of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aging\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Aging\">Aging<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> The reclusive Sorcerers have never been spotted definitively outside the twelve star clusters of the <a class=\"new\" title=\"Nihil Retreat (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvTmloaWxfUmV0cmVhdD9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Nihil Retreat<\/a> that form a protective bulwark around the <a class=\"new\" title=\"Perann Nebula (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvUGVyYW5uX05lYnVsYT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Perann Nebula<\/a>, with their true home being the mysterious planet of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Rhand (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvUmhhbmQ/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Rhand<\/a>.

Their powerful arms end in large, three fingered hands. Their heads rest on curved necks that angle toward their ground and their heavily lidded eyes appear to be solid black and pupiless.

the Tchuukthai were considered little more than beasts. Their brutish appearance and vocabulary of grunts and growls helped perpetuate that myth- a misperception the Tchuukthai were more than happy to see thrive. Over several centuries, Tchuukthai were discovered more than once. Most times, explorers avoided contact with these seemingly dangerous creatures. The few who couldn't resist the urge to learn more about them were met with vicious snarls and displays of ferocity. <\/p>\n <p>Their true intelligence remained a secret until a Jedi Master whose name is lost in antiquity, explained much about the galaxy to a Tchuukthai he'd befriended. The Tchuukthai's interest was piqued, but he was wary of leaving his home and fearful that his people would be exploited if their true nature were known. The Jedi gave his word that he would protect their secret and offered to train the Tchuukthai in the ways of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a>.

href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions\" title=\"The Unknown Regions\">The Unknown Regions<\/a>, the Chiss are largely unknown to the greater galactic community until five years after the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, when a Chiss known as Grand Admiral Thrawn rallies the Imperial remnants and goes to war against the New Republic. Even then, the Chiss remain an enigmatic, secretive Species. Their origins are largely unknown, even to the Chiss themselves, though some scientists believe they are descended from an isolated <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> colony lost to time. <\/p>\n <p>The Chiss are technologically advanced, keenly interested in art and science, and skilled at mathematics. Though logical in their mindset, they are also appreciative of philosophy, and interested in other cultures. Given their xenophobic tendencies, it comes as no surprise that the Chiss use their understanding of non-Chiss cultures to gain a tactical advantage over potential adversaries. <\/p>\n <p>Chiss society is highly ordered and structured. Rule of law is controlled and enforced by a small number of ruling \"Families.\" These ruling families, also known as clans or houses, are more akin to different branches of government than to actual familial units. As a rule, a Chiss will never knowingly do anything to bring shame upon his or her family, for entire lines have been exiled for the actions of a single family member. <\/p>\n <p>The culture of the Chiss is based on a strict code of conduct. As a rule, they do not attack an opponent unless they are attacked first. Thrawn ignores this imperative when he seizes control of the Imperial remnants, and consequently he is exiled from his people. Although most Chiss are peaceful, once embroiled in military conflict, they do not relent until their opponents are either totally destroyed, or completely subjugated. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chiss_Characteristics\">Chiss Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Many of the galaxy's perceptions of the Chiss and how they behave is initially based on the personality of Grand Admiral Thrawn. As the years pass, it becomes increasingly obvious that all Chiss are individuals, and that Thrawn was an exceptional member of his Species in a number of ways. As such, the impression of the Chiss held by the galaxy at large is that they are arrogant, aloof, and calculating individuals. While this may be true in some instances, Chiss personalities are as varied as those of any other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. In general, they tend to be well-educated, artistic, and cautious in their dealings with strangers. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Chiss have deep blue skin and red glowing eyes.

The moon has a highly unusual cycle of light and dark, sometimes illuminated brightly and other times shrouded in complete darkness. To compensate for these uncertain conditions, Gotals evolved special cones atop their heads that sense subtle shifts in the electromagnetic field, allowing them to operate in light or dark without hindrance. The cones are sensitive enough to sense not only the presence of living creatures nearby but also a creature's mood or intent.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Emotions are an important part of Gotal culture. Young Gotals live in a constant state of confusion as they are bombarded by the emotions of others. Learning to handle this input is what pushes a Gotal toward adulthood and maturity. Adult Gotals are calm, almost serene beings, but despite their outward appearance, they feel the full breadth of emotions. Because they are so sensitive to emotions, Gotals quickly form meaningful relationships with one another. Gotals prefer to be around their own kind and dislike <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids\" title=\"Droids\">Droids<\/a>, mainly because the electromagnetic fields produced by <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids\" title=\"Droids\">Droids<\/a> cause an irritating buzz perceptible to the Gotals' heightened senses. <\/p>\n <p>Gotals learned long ago to keep their opinions to themselves, and thus they make excellent negotiators and diplomats. Some individuals, however, use their natural abilities for nefarious purposes and become assassins or bounty hunters, tracking their prey by the emotional trail it broadcasts. Most <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> appreciate the self-discipline that Gotals exhibit, but some are hesitant to associate with members of the Species for fear of having their private passions and motivations revealed. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gotal_Characteristics\">Gotal Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Because they can read the emotions of other beings, Gotals have learned to be extremely polite and discreet with the information that they glean. They keep their own emotions to themselves and speak to others in neutral terms to maintain civility. Indeed, Gotals are incapable of expressing emotions in words, relying on their cones to communicate their feelings to other Gotals. As a result, Gotals speak only in abstract terms, leading most other sentients to think they are emotionless beings. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Gotals are tall creatures with flat, elongated faces. Thick, wiry hair covers most of their bodies. A Gotal's most notable feature is a pair of short cones that rises from his or her forehead. These cones pick up subtle variations in the electromagnetic fields of other beings, providing the Gotal with the locations and emotional states of the other creatures. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Gotals age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-9 Years <\/td> \n    <td>10-12 Years <\/td> \n    <td>13-40 Years <\/td> \n    <td>41-60 Years <\/td> \n    <td>61-75 Years <\/td> \n    <td>76+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> Gotals come from the moon <a class=\"new\" title=\"Antar 4 (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvQW50YXJfND9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Antar 4<\/a>, located in orbit around <a class=\"new\" title=\"Antar (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvQW50YXI/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Antar<\/a> in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Inner_Rim\" title=\"The Inner Rim\">The Inner Rim<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p><b>Languages:<\/b> Gotals speak Basic and Gotal.

Seventeen thousand years before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, one such group found the Xexto's forbears- a society of loosely organized hunter-gatherer tribes taking shelter in the trees of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Troiken (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVHJvaWtlbj9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Troiken<\/a>. They relocated a portion of the population to the nearby Quermia System and started conducting an experiment that spanned both star systems and many generations of Xexto. This experimentation created a new \"Offshoot\" Species called the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Quermians\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quermians\">Quermians<\/a>, who were left to their own devices on an idyllic world. Eventually, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanian\" title=\"Arkanian\">Arkanian<\/a> scientists either lost interest in their Xexto subjects, moving onto other experiments, or decided that risking the wrath of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic\" title=\"The Old Republic\">The Old Republic<\/a> was too great. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Xexto and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Quermian\" title=\"Quermian\">Quermian<\/a> societies did not remain primitive. Independently, they developed technologically advanced civilizations. Both were on the verge of attaining interstellar travel when Republic scouts contacted them. The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Quermians\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quermians\">Quermians<\/a> and the Xexto joined the galactic community soon thereafter. <\/p>\n <p>Genetic tests verified a commonly held theory that the Xexto and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Quermians\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quermians\">Quermians<\/a> shared an evolutionary link. The Xexto initially refused to believe they had any connection whatsoever to the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Quermians\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quermians\">Quermians<\/a> and were deeply offended by the designations that <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic\" title=\"The Old Republic\">The Old Republic<\/a> used to differentiate the two Species- Troiken Xexto and Quermian Xexto- but they eventually accepted the truth. Yet to this day, the Xexto consider the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Quermians\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quermians\">Quermians<\/a> no more than pathetic shadows of the greatness they see in themselves. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"_Xexto_Characteristics\">&nbsp;Xexto Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> The difficult terrain and dangerous predators found on their homeworld have led many Xexto to admire and encourage risk-taking.

Despite their peaceful nature, Nautolans are not above defending themselves. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Nautolans have thick green skin that is covered in dark, mottled spots. Their large, black eyes allow them to see well in dim light. Each Nautolan's head is crowned by long, tentaclelike tendrils, which the Nautolan decorates with leather bands, metal rings, or beaded ties. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b> Nautolans age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-9 Years <\/td> \n    <td>10-14 Years <\/td> \n    <td>15-40 Years <\/td> \n    <td>41-54 Years <\/td> \n    <td>55-69 Years <\/td> \n    <td>70+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> The oceanic world of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Glee_Anselm\" title=\"Glee Anselm\">Glee Anselm<\/a>, located in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim\" title=\"The Mid Rim\">The Mid Rim<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p><b>Languages:<\/b> Nautolans speak their native language of Nautila, an underwater language reliant on pheromones as much as sound.

Wikia user Lukewarner (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).<\/i> <\/p>\n <p>The Selonians are sentient mammals native to the Corellian System. Their society is organized around \"Dens.\" Each Den lives in an underground commune, that consists of one fertile female (Called the \"Queen\"), a few fertile males, and a large number of sterile females. Within the Den exist sub-groups called \"Septs\"- offspring fathered by the same fertile male- and each Sept is usually trained to perform specific tasks and jobs. A Queen can be pregnant up to five times each year, each time giving birth to five or more children. Sterile females fill most roles in Selonian society, while the Queens and males are kept safely in the Dens. Selonian \"Cities\" are actually collections of several Dens, each of which primarily specializes in a skill or craft. These Dens aid and support each other through a complicated system of bartering and favor exchanges. <\/p>\n <p>Selonians are primarily concerned with the safety of their Dens, and their people as a whole. Almost without fail, they believe that the needs of the group are more important than the desires of an individual, and every action they take is intended to further the goals of their Den, or the welfare of their Species in general.<\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Despite their seemingly primitive society, Selonian technology is on par with the galactic standard; their Dens are linked through computer networks and rapid transit systems, and their industrial production capacity helps feed the ravenous Corellian Engineering Shipyards with high-tech components. Selonians have also long been masters of their own Starship technology, building vessels that carry them throughout the Corellian System. They do not build <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive\" title=\"Hyperdrive\">Hyperdrive<\/a>-equipped ships since they do not, as a people, have much interest in venturing beyond the Corellian System. <\/p>\n <p>Their lack of interest in the galaxy at large and the policy of only sending carefully trained Selonians to interact with other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> kept the Selonians mostly safe from Imperial domination. They were swept up in power struggles that followed the collapse of Imperial rule in the Corellian System, and faced the very real possibility that their world would be destroyed. This has caused the Selonians to withdraw from most interactions with other cultures even within the Corellian System. However, the shock so unsettled Selonian society that some rare Selonians began trying to change their culture, so they can deal more honestly with other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Selonian_Characteristics\">Selonian Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Most Selonians prefer to remain on their homeworld, and don't care to interact with other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>.

While this causes many to view the Selonians as friendly, outgoing, and charitable, the reality is that most of them have no interests beyond the good of their Den. They have a deep psychological need to reach a consensus. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Comfortable walking on two legs or four, Selonians are slender beings with bodies longer than those of a baseline <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a>, but with arms and legs that are shorter. They have retractable claws on their pawlike hands. Their thick tails improve their balance when walking upright, as do their narrow faces that are tipped with bristly whiskers. They have sleek black or brown fur, and while they do not typically wear clothes on their homeworld, they wear appropriate uniforms or other outfits when visiting elsewhere. Adults stand between 1.8 meters and 2.2 meters tall, with females being larger. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b> Selonians age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-8 Years <\/td> \n    <td>9-14 Years <\/td> \n    <td>15-35 Years <\/td> \n    <td>36-55 Years <\/td> \n    <td>56-74 Years <\/td> \n    <td>75+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> <a class=\"new\" title=\"Selonia (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvU2Vsb25pYT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://swse.fandom.com\">Selonia<\/a>, a temperate world located in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Core\" title=\"The Core\">The Core<\/a>.

Though very few companies produced 4th-Degree Droids in the decades right after the New Order came to power, there were plenty of older models to choose from, and lots of replacement parts to fix them with. As years passed the old supply grew smaller, and <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid_Manufacturers\" title=\"Droid Manufacturers\">Droid Manufacturers<\/a> began experimenting with (And eventually producing) new Combat Droids. <\/p>\n <p>Although there are always those willing to employ cheap brute force, the stigma of most Clone Wars-era Military Droids made them unpopular choices as soon as new options came along. Very few <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/B1-Series_Battle_Droids\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"B1-Series Battle Droids\">B1-Series Battle Droids<\/a> were still in use by the time of the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, and most of their contemporaries were similarly retired. But for a period of a few decades, running into leftover Separatist Battle Droids was as common as running into <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rodian\" title=\"Rodian\">Rodian<\/a> bounty hunters. <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>DROID MODEL <\/th> \n    <th>CHALLENGE LEVEL <\/th> \n    <th>PLAYER DROID? <\/th> \n    <th>IMAGE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Behemoth_Junk_Droid\" title=\"Behemoth Junk Droid\">Behemoth Junk Droid<\/a> <\/td> \n    <td>CL 4 <\/td> \n    <td>No <\/td> \n    <td> <\/td>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Brute_Junk_Droid\" title=\"Brute Junk Droid\">Brute Junk Droid<\/a> <\/td> \n    <td>CL 3 <\/td> \n    <td>No <\/td> \n    <td> <\/td>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Junk_Droid\" title=\"Junk Droid\">Junk Droid<\/a> <\/td> \n    <td>CL 1 <\/td> \n    <td>Yes <\/td> \n    <td> <\/td>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/R-1_Recon_Droid\" title=\"R-1 Recon Droid\">R-1 Recon Droid<\/a> <\/td> \n    <td>CL 1 <\/td> \n    <td>Yes <\/td> \n    <td> <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide\"><a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Clone Wars Campaign Guide\">Clone Wars Campaign Guide<\/a><\/span><\/h3> \n <p>The Clone Wars saw the rapid development of Droid technology, mainly due to the Separatists' heavy reliance on Droid military units.
