The unusual structure of their brain led Imperial xenobiologists to conclude that they were a distinctly alien <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p>The highly evolved Sakiyan brain is nearly twice the size of the average <a href=\"/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> brain. While the <a href=\"/wiki/Bith\" title=\"Bith\">Bith<\/a> brain remains one of the most advanced among common alien <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, the parts of the Sakiyan brain that process sensory input are superior even to the <a href=\"/wiki/Bith\" title=\"Bith\">Bith<\/a>. These keen senses helped primitive Sakiyans survive against the fierce predators of their homeworld, but even as the <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> developed the intellect to use tools and construct weapons and shelters, they retained their sharp senses. In fact, Sakiyans possess what other <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> consider nigh-supernatural perception. <\/p>\n <p>A series of offworld invasions punctuate Sakiyan history, during which the culture survived by maintaining a constant state of vigilance. Evacuation plans are meticulously prepared and constantly revised. Most Sakiyan communities have multiple plans for evacuation in case of invasion and war. Further, every household and government agency relies on lightweight repulsorlift platforms to quickly transport people, resources, and supplies to safe havens. Once mobile, Sakiyan troops then conduct a constant series of hit-and-run attacks against enemies until their invaders withdraw from the conquered lands. Sakiyan colonies carry with them the tradition of defense and mobility, resisting domination by <a href=\"/wiki/The_Sith\" title=\"The Sith\">The Sith<\/a>, the forces of the Tion Hegemony, and other oppressors. In recent centuries, they have fallen under the economic control of the <a href=\"/wiki/Hutts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hutts\">Hutts<\/a>, but have averted outright enslavement by keeping the \"Slugs\" at arm's length in every place except <a class=\"new\" title=\"Saki (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvU2FraT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\">Saki's<\/a> major trade centers. <\/p>\n <p>The ties between the Sakiyans and the <a href=\"/wiki/Hutts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hutts\">Hutts<\/a> are primarily forged around repulsorlift technology. Sakiyans quickly adopted and improved repulsorlift technology introduced to them by Old Republic scouts. Over the centuries, they have adapted the technology to their needs, focusing primarily on making the motivators smaller and more efficient. The <a href=\"/wiki/Hutts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hutts\">Hutts<\/a> are particularly fond of Sakiyan repulsorlift technology, as it allows them to construct smaller and more elegant repulsor sleds. <\/p>\n <p>Thanks to its location near the heart of Hutt Space, the Sakiyan homeworld escaped the tyranny of the Empire, although many Sakiyan technicians were forced to relocate to Imperial research installations, where they contributed to the development of a new generation of Imperial repulsortanks. The Saki System also escaped the notice of the <a href=\"/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong\" title=\"Yuuzhan Vong\">Yuuzhan Vong<\/a> as they pressed into Hutt Space- at least during the first advance. The Sakiyan leadership remains concerned that their traditional method of dealing with alien invasions may not work if the war fleets of the <a href=\"/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong\" title=\"Yuuzhan Vong\">Yuuzhan Vong<\/a> strike against their home.

They unified early in their history under a single world government, thus managing to avoid the devastating wars that plague many worlds on the verge of becoming spacefaring societies. They enjoyed a nearly uninterrupted development of philosophy, arts, medicine, and mathematical theories. Their manufacturing, irrigation, mining, and construction methods are quite advanced, although their overall technology level lags far behind what's considered the galactic standard. Their unique honeycomblike cities are spread across the planet, yet their environment remains almost as clean as that found on unsettled worlds. The Omwati managed to do what few Species have accomplished- a balance between the production needs of a technologically advanced society and sound stewardship of their world's resources. <\/p>\n <p>The first Old Republic ship to visit <a href=\"/wiki/Omwat\" title=\"Omwat\">Omwat<\/a> was a <i><a href=\"/wiki/Victory_I-Class_Star_Destroyer\" title=\"Victory I-Class Star Destroyer\">Victory I<\/a><\/i><a href=\"/wiki/Victory_I-Class_Star_Destroyer\" title=\"Victory I-Class Star Destroyer\">-Class Star Destroyer<\/a> commanded by future Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. Omwati society- after some initial shock- welcomed the visitors. Tarkin and his team left technological, cultural, and historical data behind for the Omwati to study and departed with a promise of other ships to come. Tarkin did not inform the Omwati that their world must have been visited by ancient ships of the early Republic, since their kind did indeed exist elsewhere in the universe- in fact, a small community thrived on <a href=\"/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a>.<\/p>\n <p>More than a decade passed before Tarkin would return to <a href=\"/wiki/Omwat\" title=\"Omwat\">Omwat<\/a>. Always a forward-looking man, he had decided to keep the native society on <a href=\"/wiki/Omwat\" title=\"Omwat\">Omwat<\/a> a secret among himself and his fellow mission commanders, hoping some day that they would be able to profit from a world that could be his personal think tank. When the Emperor gave Tarkin dominion over <a href=\"/wiki/The_Outer_Rim_Territories\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Outer Rim Territories\">The Outer Rim Territories<\/a>, the Grand Moff felt the time had come to exploit the Omwati. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>While Imperial diplomats kept the people of <a href=\"/wiki/Omwat\" title=\"Omwat\">Omwat<\/a> enthralled with tales of galactic society (Never mentioning their cousins elsewhere in the galaxy), Tarkin supervised the construction of an orbital education facility. Once it was complete, the Imperials revealed their true nature. The Omwati would conduct planetwide intelligence and aptitude tests and surrender those children who score the highest, they were told; resistance would result in the destruction of their cities from orbit. The Omwati reluctantly agreed. They surrendered hundreds of Omwati children, never hearing from them again. <\/p>\n <p>When Tarkin and many of his closest associates were killed in the destruction of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Death_Star\" title=\"The Death Star\">The Death Star<\/a>, the orbital facility at <a href=\"/wiki/Omwat\" title=\"Omwat\">Omwat<\/a> was abandoned. In the meantime, the Omwati had been secretly developing craft capable of breaking free from the gravitational pull of their world and managed to reach the satellite. They did not recover the lost children, but they found technology that helped them greatly advance their own fledgling space program. The Omwati developed their first hyperdrive-capable vessel roughly ten years after the Battle of <a href=\"/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a>. This development was spurred by the desire to find the children who had become lost among the stars. The Omwati did not want to believe the satellite's data that implied all but ten were dead. <\/p>\n <p>Omwati explorers were eventually contacted by New Republic diplomats- but only after these Omwati terrorized a number of small <a href=\"/wiki/Outer_Rim\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Outer Rim\">Outer Rim<\/a> colonies and refueling posts- and another of the Empire's atrocities became fully documented.

They inhabit the planet's sprawling jungles and rainforests. <\/p>\n <p>Although the Tarasin enjoyed peaceful first contact with <a href=\"/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> explorers during the time of the Old Republic, their dealings with offworlders soured when trading companies began plundering Cularin's natural resources, uprooting entire forests. The Tarasin, sensitive to <a href=\"/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a>, believed in living harmoniously with the land, rather than exploiting it's bounty as the newcomers did. They fought back with surprising ferocity. A treaty helped avert further bloodshed. A friendship, strained at first, grew as the Tarasin and the outsiders got to know each other and started to pursue their own agendas. <\/p>\n <p>As more alien <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> arrived on <a href=\"/wiki/Cularin\" title=\"Cularin\">Cularin<\/a>, the Tarasin worried more about the future of their home. The offworlders built their cities on platforms that rose above the forest canopies, preserving the natural environment while giving the visitors a place to call home. However, the Tarasin denied certain companies access to the planet's resources and were particularly protective of the ch'hala trees that were sacred to their religion. Words escalated into violence. The trading companies decided to send armed troops down with their workers and Droids to avoid losing valuable equipment. Tarasin reprisals were swift and deadly. The Tarasin tribes demonstrated that they could use the technology of their alien adversaries, and their natural abilities with <a href=\"/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a> made them devastating in combat.<\/p>\n <p><a href=\"/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi<\/a> refused to intervene in the Tarasin Revolt. The Trade Federation, holding major interests on <a href=\"/wiki/Cularin\" title=\"Cularin\">Cularin<\/a>, sent War Droids to secure their operations and protect their crews. The Droids interpreted their orders loosely and decimated the nearby Tarasin tribes in a brutal raid. This outrage prompted a series of bloody counterattacks. Ultimately, <a href=\"/wiki/The_Jedi_Order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Order\">The Jedi Order<\/a> felt compelled to intervene and sent two Jedi Consulars to negotiate a new treaty. The Tarasin refused to give in to outsider demands, and after six months of tense negotiations, all sides agreed to an accord called the Cularin Compact, sharply curtailing the outsiders' ability to harm the planet. For their part, the Tarasin struggled to work with offworlders, allowing them to harvest limited resources while protecting the planet's ecological balance. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Later years saw many conflicts among the various trading companies and cartels for control of Cularin's resources, but few of these conflicts involved or affected the Tarasin directly. <\/p>\n <p>During <a href=\"/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Rebellion Era\">The Rebellion Era<\/a>, the Empire seized control of all mining operations on <a href=\"/wiki/Cularin\" title=\"Cularin\">Cularin<\/a>, but the Imperials did nothing to invite conflict with the Tarasin. The planet had little to offer, and the Imperials regarded the Tarasin as a primitive, backwater Species with little potential. The Tarasin hid their mastery of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Force\" title=\"The Force\">The Force<\/a>, and unsubstantiated rumors persisted that at least a handful of Jedi took refuge among the Tarasin after escaping the Jedi Purge. <\/p>\n <p>The fall of the Empire spelled the return of the trading cartels, but <a href=\"/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a> was quick to reinstate the Cularin Compact, ensuring that these companies would not despoil the planet. The Tarasin enjoyed their diplomatic dealings with <a href=\"/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a>, and a few Force-sensitive Tarasin even expressed interest in joining the New Jedi Order to help repel <a href=\"/wiki/The_Yuuzhan_Vong_Empire\" title=\"The Yuuzhan Vong Empire\">The Yuuzhan Vong Empire<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p>Most Tarasin dwell in tribal villages. Their tribes, called Irstats, are small (Between thirty and fifty members each) and led by a chieftain (Called the Irstat-Kes), usually the second oldest female in the tribe.

This near-invisibility has earned the Defel the nickname \"Wraiths\" because in visible light, they appear as nothing more than vague shadows.

However, they also possess a strong streak of independence in personal matters.

Nearly 1,000 years before the Battle of <a href=\"/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, Nuknog leaders \"Sold\" their homeworld to a consortium of unscrupulous mining corporations in exchange for jobs, food, and modest accommodations. <\/p>\n <p> The Nuknog worked in mines and processing factories, performing tasks deemed too dangerous for offworld personnel. They received no money for their work, ate leftovers, and slept in tight, prefabricated military barracks. Shoddy equipment and mining accidents claimed countless Nuknog lives, and all that time the Nuknog had no sense that the corporations were exploiting and mistreating them. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Nuknog remained the unknowing slaves of one corporation or another for centuries as mining contracts changed hands. It wasn't until a pair of Jedi came to the planet in search of a wanted criminal that the mistreatment of the Nuknog caught the attention of the greater galactic community. The Republic Senate ordered the mining corporations to terminate all operations on the Nuknog homeworld and repay several centuries' worth of lost wages. The corporations dissolved amid the controversy, leaving the Nuknog with empty mines, empty factories, and empty stomachs. Sympathy for the Nuknog ran high. Republic relief workers delivered emergency food supplies to the starving Nuknog and offered to help rebuild the planet's devastated agricultural industry. Thinking that the Republic, like the mining corporations might be manipulating them in some fashion, the Nuknog took the free food but blamed the Republic for depriving them of the only life they knew. Their leaders demanded that the Republic provide the Nuknog with food and supplies in perpetuity. When it became clear that the Nuknog were unwilling to help themselves, all sympathy for the Species evaporated. <\/p>\n <p>With the rise of the Separatists and the events leading up to the Clone Wars, the Republic faced political turmoil on many fronts. The plight of the Nuknog no longer captured the interest of the Senate or the galaxy at large. The Nuknog now had another reason to resent the Republic. <\/p>\n <p>The Nuknog change very little after the Clone Wars and the fall of the Republic. The average life expectancy of a Nuknog is nearly doubled if it makes its home offworld- a luxury few Nuknog can afford.

Those who do must contend with the Zygerrians' natural combat prowess, since Zygerrians are excellent fighters with or without weapons. <\/p>\n <p>Zygerrian society is built on the principle that strength leads to authority, and for Zygerrians, strength can mean many things- physical strength, and also strength of will, or conviction, and of bravery. Zygerrians are difficult to defeat in any arena because their physical resilience is matched by their indomitable spirit. Enemies of the Zygerrians quickly learn that you cannot make Zygerrians flinch. They would sooner die than bend to the desires of others. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Zygerrian_Characteristics\">Zygerrian Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Zygerrians are aggressive and violent.

Although they have been part of galactic civilization for millennia, very few Umbarans have left their home system, and even fewer have risen to positions of power and fame in the galaxy. Umbarans are interested in alien cultures and civilizations, but they prefer to observe from a distance rather than take an active role in events. <\/p>\n <p>During the rise of the Empire, the Umbarans spend a few decades moving through the halls of supreme political power. An Umbaran named Sly Moore serves as Palpatine's chief aide during his later years as Chancellor of the Republic and the earliest period of his reign as Emperor. Moore's prominence in galactic politics causes her to be so admired on her homeworld that she inspires other Umbarans to venture out into the rest of the galaxy. Many of them join Moore on <a href=\"/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a>, and soon Umbarans are a common sight on that world. <\/p>\n <p>As Palpatine's New Order becomes increasingly biased toward <a href=\"/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans<\/a>, Moore vanishes from the Emperor's side and moves into more shadowy roles within his government. From deep within the intelligence apparatus, she and other Umbarans lead efforts to root out anyone who is not unquestionably loyal to Emperor Palpatine, and they answer only to the Emperor. They are so effective that even Emperor Palpatine's most dedicated followers grow to fear them, something that strengthens the antialien sentiment among many of the Emperor's closest advisers. The Umbarans are particularly disliked by officers of Imperial Intelligence, who resent the fact that they are subject to Umbaran scrutiny- a resentment that grows every time the Umbarans unmask a Rebel double agent in their ranks. <\/p>\n <p>After the death of Emperor Palpatine and the collapse of his government, the Umbarans find themselves under threat from the Rebels they had hunted and the New Order supporters they had intimidated. When former head of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard forges a powerful coalition on <a href=\"/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a> dedicated to reestablishing a strong Galactic Empire, the remaining Umbarans flee the planet, knowing that Isard will seek brutal revenge for the embarrassments they caused her organization when she was rising through the ranks of Imperial Intelligence. <\/p>\n <p>Even before the fall of the Empire, however, Umbarans already begin to retreat from the galaxy. As the full scope of Emperor Palpatine's evil becomes more evident and knowledge of the atrocities committed in his name more widespread, the Umbarans grow embarrassed over Moore's association with the Emperor, and they resume their reclusive ways. In fact, they withdraw even more fully than before, fearing retribution from the many <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> surrounding them. <\/p>\n <p>As memories of the Empire start to fade in the minds of the galaxy's beings, Umbarans begin to filter back out into the galaxy in the low numbers typical of their off-world presence during the Old Republic. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Umbaran_Characteristics\">Umbaran Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Umbarans seem aloof, distant, and cold to all but their closest friends and family members, and it is a rare observer who has the patience to wait for an Umbaran to let his or her guard down. As such, the few Umbarans active beyond their homeworld tend to be regarded by other beings as ciphers. Because of this emotional distance, many non-Umbarans mistakenly assume that Umbarans are indifferent to those around them. Nothing could be further from the truth. Although Umbarans keep their own affairs private, they constantly and quietly try to learn as much as they can about the affairs of others. The Umbaran knack for uncovering secrets has led to rumors that all members of the Species are telepaths, but the truth is that they move about unnoticed simply because of their outsider status, listening and observing all the while. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Umbarans are thinly built humanoids with sunken eyes and pallid skin tones that range from snowy white to pale blue.

They were known to have arisen from their isolated homeworld, whereupon they began to cut a swath of destruction across countless systems. These campaigns saw entire races being hunted to extinction by the savage Esh-kha, who expanded into their conquered worlds. The population of the Esh-kha expanded as their living space increased and this led to the rise of a new rival patriarch, even as the old one was still alive. Such an event was unmarked by this Species and this new patriarch, known as Hallow Voice, proposed a more peaceful approach in their dealings with other races through cooperation. As the Esh-kha population grew too large, Hallow Voice took a number of his followers away who settled on other worlds in order to reach out to other nearby cultures. <\/p>\n <p> Despite their works, the Esh-kha were too well known for violence and mass destruction, and only a few tentative alliances are formed.

Xenoanthropologists date the first Pau'an civilizations back almost 57,000 years before the Battle of <a href=\"/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, making theirs one of the youngest known civilizations. Though no written history of this time exists, scientists currently theorize that the long-lived Pau'ans are genetically closer to their progenitor <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, and that as a result of their longevity the Pau'ans have likely only evolved a little since the planet was settled. <\/p>\n <p>Some time in the last ten thousand years, <a href=\"/wiki/Utapau\" title=\"Utapau\">Utapau<\/a> underwent a climate change that caused winds on the surface of the world to reach and maintain constant bursts at destructive speeds. Experts from the University of Sanbra speculate that the climate change was likely very sudden (At least, sudden in geological terms) given the fact that the Pau'an <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> did not evolve or adapt to the high winds as many other <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> did. The long gap between Pau'an generations caused by their extremely long lives was probably responsible for this evolutionary stumbling block, and were it not for the migration of Pau'an civilization underground they might not have survived the climate change.<\/p>\n <p>The shift to life underground did not change the <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species'<\/a> eating habits, as they maintained many of the biological signs of a carnivorous diet. The ecology of <a href=\"/wiki/Utapau\" title=\"Utapau\">Utapau<\/a>, particularly with regard to an abundance of animal life in sinkholes and below ground, allowed the Pau'ans to retain their carnivorous ways, which persist into modern times. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <h3><span id=\"Pau'an_Characteristics\"><\/span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pau.27an_Characteristics\">Pau'an Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Despite their appearances, Pau'ans are exceptionally friendly on the whole and are particularly kind toward outsiders.

An escalating war with the competing empire of the <a href=\"/wiki/Chiss\" title=\"Chiss\">Chiss<\/a> forced the Ssi-Ruuk to look toward the galactic Core for \"Recruits\" for their space fleet. The Ssi-Ruuvi forces consisted mostly of self-propelled Battle Droids powered by the life energies and enslaved consciousness of captured humanoids subjected to a process \"Entechment.\" <\/p>\n <p>The Ssi-Ruuk attacked and subjected the citizens of a number of isolated <a href=\"/wiki/Outer_Rim\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Outer Rim\">Outer Rim<\/a> settlements before clashing directly with the Empire's fleet. Rather than bringing the full might of the Imperial Navy to bear on the Ssi-Ruuk invaders, the Emperor negotiated to a secret treaty with them. Using prisoners and slaves as some of the raw materials for Battle Droids appealed to the Emperor; in exchange for data on the Ssi-Ruuk entechment process, Palpatine secretly ceded a number of <a href=\"/wiki/Outer_Rim\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Outer Rim\">Outer Rim<\/a> systems to the Ssi-Ruuk to do with as they pleased. <\/p>\n <p>One of these star systems was <a href=\"/wiki/Bakura\" title=\"Bakura\">Bakura<\/a>, a small colony that had been settled by a <a href=\"/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> religious fringe group centuries before. While the Emperor saw no value to it, its governor had at his disposal forces that were skilled enough to repel the initial Ssi-Ruuvi strike. The governor sent a desperate message to <a href=\"/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a>, notifying them of the unidentified invading force and asking for reinforcements. The message went unanswered by the governor's Imperial masters- but <a href=\"/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance<\/a> intercepted the message and dispatched a task force to help shortly after the Battle of <a href=\"/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a>.

This led to on-again, off-again diplomatic talks with the Ssi-Ruuk, who lacked the resources to wage war on two fronts. Diplomatic talks with the Ssi-Ruuk continue well into <a href=\"/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era\" title=\"The New Jedi Order Era\">The New Jedi Order Era<\/a>, but they have not completely eliminated border skirmishes.

Black-scaled Ssi-Ruuk are usually trained as assassins, while brown-scaled Ssi-Ruuk have no caste whatsoever and are treated as outcasts. <\/p>\n <p>Like many reptilian beings, the Ssi-Ruuk have poor vision but an excellent sense of smell.

Their origins are a complete mystery, and when pressed, most Dragons politely deflect such investigations. As such, very little is known about the Duinuogwuin, though it is well known that they have incredibly long life-spans, and they are often sought by the most powerful of political leaders for counsel on galaxy-influencing matters. There is a high degree of genetic diversity from dragon to dragon, some do not require atmosphere to breathe, instead able to draw on solar radiation for sustenance, while others are merely able to hold their breath for months at a time. Some Duinuogwuin can even breathe fire. <\/p>\n <p>Most Star Dragons prefer to live a life of complete isolation, and despite the absolute joy that fills every Duinuogwuin when spending time among their own kind, their conscience forces the <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> to wander the galaxy alone. When two Duinuogwuin mate, the offspring is more often beast than child, and researchers speculate that everything from the <a class=\"new\" title=\"Exogorth Space Slug (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvRXhvZ29ydGhfU3BhY2VfU2x1Zz9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\">Exogorth Space Slugs<\/a> to <a href=\"/wiki/Krayt_Dragons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Krayt Dragons\">Krayt Dragons<\/a> or the <a class=\"new\" title=\"Kadri-ra (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvS2FkcmktcmE/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\">Kadri-ra<\/a> are the results of their less successful unions. It is theorized that at one time in the distant past; the Duinuogwuin did not restrain their drive to reproduce, and unleashed a thousand horrors upon the galaxy, resulting in them being hunted, and their world being destroyed. While this would explain their guilt and self-imposed isolation from most sentients, it remains a theory. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Duinuogwuin_Characteristics\">Duinuogwuin Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Because of their incredibly long lives, often spanning two millennia, Star Dragons are amongst the wisest sentients in the galaxy. However, their long life-span makes them cautious to act, typically preferring to let time solve all problems. Duinuogwuin place a high value on solitude, and prefer to spend their time exploring all the sights the galaxy has to offer. However, some Duinuogwuin are born with a much less passive view on the galaxy. These evil beings are manipulative, and feel it is silly the Duinuogwuin don\u2019t rule the galaxy with their mighty intellect and wisdom. Most Duinuogwuin of this disposition are put down by their fellow dragons quickly, but some escape to cause trouble for the galaxy. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Large, long dragons with segmented, caterpillar-like bodies, with each segment supporting a pair of legs and wings. The most forward segment supports the neck and head, and has arms instead of legs. Their head has a much more canine appearance, and their bodies are covered in fine, soft scales, nearly giving the appearance of skin. Coloration varies slightly among grey tones of white, silver, blue, black and purple. <\/p>\n <p><b>Average Height/Weight:<\/b> A typical Duinuogwuin stands more than 4.9 meters tall and weighs more than 600 kilograms. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Duinuogwuin age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-20 Years <\/td> \n    <td>21-100 Years <\/td> \n    <td>101-650 Years <\/td> \n    <td>651-1,200 Years <\/td> \n    <td>1,201-2,000 Years <\/td> \n    <td>2,001+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table>\n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> Unknown, though there is a mythical \u201cGraveyard of the Dragons\u201d, which most Duinuogwuin return to at the end of their lives.

Experiencing pleasure in its myriad forms is the lifetime pursuit of all Zeltrons. They are a fun-loving species, placing recreation before other, less worldly interests. Members of the species are found throughout the galaxy, for they enjoy traveling, meeting new people, indulging in their passions, and experiencing new things. <\/p>\n <p>Zeltrons are born with a latent empathy that allows them to sense the emotions of others. Though not ruled by emotions of others, they can, over time, become inundated with negative feelings if they are surrounded by such sentiments for a prolonged period of time. For this reason, many Zeltrons are pacifistic, preferring peaceful negotiation to the destructive actions of combat. This is not to say that Zeltrons are incapable of defending themselves; their passion gives them a great capacity for violence when the situation warrants.

Further, the Yinchorri were deemed too primitive to be any great boon to the Republic. So, they were largely ignored until a year before the Invasion of <a href=\"/wiki/Naboo\" title=\"Naboo\">Naboo<\/a>, when they officially joined the Republic. They gained interstellar travel capabilities, most likely from stolen technology, shortly after their admission into the Galactic Senate. <\/p>\n <p>Slavers quickly learned to avoid the Yinchorr System, as the Yinchorri made terrible slaves- they tended to fight to the death rather than be enslaved, while individuals were so uncooperative that they either starved themselves to death or had to be put down.<\/p>\n <p>Until shortly before the Battle of <a href=\"/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a>, the Yinchorri lived in city states, with each community fielding its own any and having its own leaders, usually a Council of Elders. Each city-state had a number of satellite communities that grew food and mined resources for the central city, and a city's power was measured by how many smaller settlements are needed to keep it supplied. For many centuries, Tol-Kachorn was the mightiest of ail Yinchorri city-states, with nearly one hundred villages and five other cities and attendant communities under its rule. Other cities occasionally tried to equal or rival Tol-Kachorn, which led to brutal campaigns of conquest. Followed by widespread chaos in the region once the emerging empire collapsed. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Yinchorri initially went unnoticed and undisturbed by the Emperor's New Order; as the system contained few resources, no one felt the need to call attention to the obstinate Species that dwelled there. The one exception- and one of Yinchorr's greatest tragedies- was when the system's Imperial governor decided the Yinchorri could serve as the perfect bait in a plot to capture Princess Leia (And advance his career past a dead-end posting ln a useless star system). He captured the leaders of the various Yinchorri Councils of Elders and offered to trade their lives back to the Yinchorri in exchange for Leia. The Yinchorri people felt that the life of one <a href=\"/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> was an adequate price for their beloved eiders, so they set a trap for the Rebel leader. When the governor tried to double-cross the Yinchorri, the angry natives overthrew him and his regime. <\/p>\n <p>After becoming fully aware of the evil of the Empire, the Tol-Kachorn Council of Elders threw their support behind <a href=\"/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance<\/a>. As the Rebellion established bases in the Yinchorr System, other Yinchorri city-states offered their warriors and Starships to the fight as well. <\/p>\n <p>The Empire punished the Yinchorri for their revolt. The sector's Moff, with the full blessing of the Imperial High Command, ordered a massive assault against <a href=\"/wiki/Yinchorr\" title=\"Yinchorr\">Yinchorr<\/a>, and shortly after the fall of Echo Base on <a href=\"/wiki/Hoth\" title=\"Hoth\">Hoth<\/a>, the Rebel bases in the <a href=\"/wiki/Yinchorr\" title=\"Yinchorr\">Yinchorr<\/a> system were leveled. The cities of Yinchorri were also pounded to rubble by orbital bombardments- even the long history of mighty Tol-Kachorn ended that day. The surviving Yinchorri were reduced to living as nomadic tribes. The devastation on <a href=\"/wiki/Yinchorr\" title=\"Yinchorr\">Yinchorr<\/a> came to the Emperor's personal attention a few months later, and shortly before the Battle of <a href=\"/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a> he ordered all training facilities of his elite personal guard to be consolidated in that system. <a href=\"/wiki/Yinchorr\" title=\"Yinchorr\">Yinchorr<\/a> remained under Imperial domination until nearly a decade after the destruction of the Yinchorri cities; the system was liberated by New Republic forces as part of the campaign to reclaim the territory seized by the forces led by what was reportedly the Emperor's clone. <\/p>\n <p>The surviving Yinchorri came together under the banner of the last son of the leader of Tol-Kachorn's Elder Council. They have since settled in the heavily defended complex once used as the headquarters of the Emperor's Imperial Guard and are currently trying to rebuild their civilization. Yinchorr remains an independent star system into <a href=\"/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era\" title=\"The New Jedi Order Era\">The New Jedi Order Era<\/a>. While the system continues to host a New Republic military base and a small Starship repair facility, the Yinchorri have not yet applied for membership in <a href=\"/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p>From the moment they hatch, the Yinchorri join tightly knit, highly supportive communities- first their parents and clutchmates, later the entire village they grow up in, then their professional peers and superiors, and finally, a family of their own. When a Yinchorri mates, he or she does so for life, and it is quite common for a widowed individual to die from sorrow within a few days of losing his or her spouse. While the Yinchorri have taken to space travel, few have settled off their homeworld. Those who have, however have brought their entire extended family with them, essentially transplanting entire villages at a time. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Yinchorri_Characteristics\">Yinchorri Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b>&nbsp;Yinchorri are resolute, pragmatic, and possessive.

The Jawas have a poor reputation and are regarded as thieves at best, vermin at worst. Their off-putting nature is made worse by the sour smell that clings to them and their inexplicable and nonsensical language. Jawas survive by scavenging lost technology in the desert wastes. \"Lost\" for Jawas is ambiguous; they are likely to snatch up anything that's not bolted down. Moisture farmers and others who live far from Spaceports regularly find that their belongings have vanished in the night with only tell-tale Jawa tracks leading off into the wasteland. <\/p>\n <p>Jawas are intelligent and have a complex society. Gathering in extended tribes, Jawa life revolves around trade- not for wealth, but for survival. Jawas look for guidance from their shamans, usually a female Jawa with the ability to portent the future and cast vicious hexes. Once a year, the Jawa tribes gather in the Dune Sea to exchange sons and daughters, to swap stories and news, and to mingle among their own kind. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jawa_Characteristics\">Jawa Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Jawas are peaceful, preferring flight to confrontations.

A Jawa can become fierce- even vicious- when cornered or when a shaman is threatened. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Jawas wear brown hooded cloaks to protect themselves from the oppressive heat of the twin suns of <a href=\"/wiki/Tatooine\" title=\"Tatooine\">Tatooine<\/a>.

The appearance of alien beings in ships with technology beyond anything the Toong had imagined threw their planet into chaos. The revelation triggered a war between many of their homeworld's nations. Covert observation of the Species by first-contact specialists assigned to the scouting mission indicated that the Toong were a peaceful and outgoing Species, so the panic and violence that followed first contact came as a complete shock to the scouts. It took weeks to reestablish contact with the Toong, and only then did Republic diplomats and scouts realize they had overlooked something: although highly evolved mentally, the Toong Species retains a keen fight-or-flight instinct that frequently manifests as acute social anxiety. The sudden appearance of strange beings from the stars caused mass panic. A tremendous effort on the part of the first-contact team and Jedi Councilors hastily dispatched from <a href=\"/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a> prevented massive warfare that would have destroyed Toong society. <\/p>\n <p> Once the Toong became comfortable with the idea of being part of a great galactic community, they united under a single planetary government and joined <a href=\"/wiki/The_Old_Republic\" title=\"The Old Republic\">The Old Republic<\/a>.

These colonies are typically organized around mining or farming efforts, and the Toong colonists enjoy minimal contact with other sentient <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. A few rare Toong work outside the Toong'L System or its colonies as accountants, mechanics, or even scouts and bounty hunters, but more often than not, they gravitate to positions where they don't have to interact with others. <\/p>\n <p>Visitors to Toong'L are often surprised to learn that rocket-jumping, Podracing, and aircar demolition debris are favorite pastimes among the Toong. Further, many raiders who felt Toong ships or communities would be easy targets for piracy realized Toong fight back if forced into a corner by excessive demands or obvious threats to their livelihood. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Toong_Characteristics\">Toong Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Toong exhibit extreme nervousness in social situations.

The <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> did not develop space travel on their own, but shortly after Republic scouts made contact with the world many decades ago, entire villages sought employment with the Republic and interstellar corporations, fascinated by the possibility of exploring the galaxy. In all three major <a href=\"/wiki/Eras_of_Play\" title=\"Eras of Play\">Eras of Play<\/a>, most worlds located at trade-route junctions have at least one Arcona colony, and Arcona can be found at virtually every large spaceport- either as travelers or operators of businesses. <\/p>\n <p>While most beings consider Arcona cities on <a href=\"/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a> quainty low-tech, the planet has several impressive starports, and many of the galaxy's mining companies operate on <a href=\"/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a>. The system in general, and <a href=\"/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a> in particular, boasts rich rare-mineral deposits. Water is the most precious substance on <a href=\"/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a>, so the Arcona sold the mining rights to the firms for massive shipments of water. Although the Arcona derive many essential nutrients directly from the world's atmosphere, they also need to consume water and other liquids to keep secondary circulatory systems in their bodies healthy. (This has led some planetary geologists to hypothesize that <a href=\"/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a> lost much of it's water in some geologically recent catastrophe, though this remains unproven.) <\/p>\n <p>When it was discovered the Arcona can easily and hopelessly become addicted to sodium chloride (Salt) by ingesting even a gram or two of the substance, unscrupulous merchants almost destroyed Arcona society by creating several generations of salt addicts. Salt induces vivid, colorful hallucinations in Arcona, but repeated use damages their body's ability to absorb life-giving ammonia. Only the intervention of the Republic saved the Arcona. The Senate passed draconian laws that punished the importation of salt to the Teke Ro System or to Arcona communities elsewhere in the galaxy, and the Arcona themselves zealously police their communities. Arcona addicted to salt are easily identifiable; their multifaceted eyes turn from green to gold. <\/p>\n <p>The center of Arcona society is the family, and communities consist of several loosely affiliated extended families.

At different times in its history, Arkanian has belonged to both the Republic and the Sith Empire, and played important roles in each. Knowledge and research are extremely important to the Arkanians, and they are highly skilled academicians and scientists. It is therefore not surprising that <a href=\"/wiki/Arkania\" title=\"Arkania\">Arkania<\/a> would become a main repository of the history of the Sith Empire, as well as home to vast libraries of information from across the galaxy. <\/p>\n <p>Arkanians are not afraid to profit from their research and high intelligence. Arkanian corporations amass wealth by bringing key medical treatments and technology to the market at opportune times. Many in the galaxy find the Arkanians arrogant and aloof. They are horrified by the direction of some Arkanian research, particularly their work in genetic engineering. Indeed, the Arkanians are known to have transformed entire <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> over the course of generations, often to the detriment of the <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>.&nbsp; <\/p>\n <p>Even the Arkanian <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> itself had not been off-limits to research and genetic engineering. Specific subspecies, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoot\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoot\">Arkanian Offshoots<\/a>, were engineered for specific tasks. However, the <a href=\"/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoot\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoot\">Arkanian Offshoots<\/a> are less harder and shorter lived than the original Arkanians- a trait not helped by occasional attempts by racist Purebloods to wipe them out. They also differ in physical appearance, typically in skin tone, eyes, and ears. Reactions to <a href=\"/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoot\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoot\">Arkanian Offshoots<\/a> vary widely within Arkanian society. Much to the horror of the occasional outsiders who visit <a href=\"/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoot\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoot\">Arkanian Offshoot<\/a> communities, some Arkanian regard them as merely tools or as a slave <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. However, such feelings are not universal. Many regard the <a href=\"/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoot\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoot\">Arkanian Offshoots<\/a> as an example of the cruel consequences of Arkanian corporate greed.&nbsp; <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arkanian_Characteristics\">Arkanian Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality: <\/b>Arkanians are arrogant and regard themselves superior to all other <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>.

Although technology would eventually lessen the need for this form of hibernation, Snivvians still feel the need- biologically and culturally- to continue the tradition.<\/p>\n <p>Historically, Snivvians have withstood numerous hardships that they channel into their impressive artistic works. After gaining the ability to travel between the stars, the Snivvians attracted the attention of the brutal Thalassian slavers. Snivvian culture was nearly destroyed before the Republic discovered the practice and stepped in to protect the Snivvians. This protection has been reduced during eras of warfare, but combined Republic and Snivvian forces remain sufficient to hold off lesser threats. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>During the Old Republic era, the Snivvians were still rebuilding the damage done to their society by the slavers and other threats. They proceed with the intent to colonize other worlds.

The Reslian Purge, as it became known, wiped out millions of Tunroth. The primitive hunters lacked the weaponry to repel the Lortan invaders. The intervention of the Imperial Navy ended the Reslian Purge, and although the Imperials interceded only to safeguard their own interests, the Tunroth still owed the Empire a debt of gratitude. The Species reluctantly accepted Imperial rule, and many Tunroth became unlikely supporters of the Emperor's New Order. After the fall of the Empire, the Tunroth hesitated to join <a href=\"/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a> for fear of being seen as Imperial sympathizers. However, their fears proved unfounded, as <a href=\"/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a> welcomed Tunroth membership. <\/p> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Tunroth live in communes of 50 to 300 individuals, each commune governed by a great hunter. The Assemblage of Three- a body made up of the three highest-level hunters- governs Tunroth society. They assemble whenever an issue that concerns all Tunroth arises, such as the need to colonize more worlds, alleviate overcrowding, or deal with an external threat. <\/p>\n <p>Tunroth leaders who forbade blasters in favor of traditional hunting weapons changed their view after the Reslian Purge, to the point where the Tunroth now stockpile blasters and other modern weapons for the express purpose of defending their communes. The Species' adoption of modern weaponry has not diminished the Tunroth hunting tradition. 27 different levels of Tunroth hunter are known to exist, and each has its own strict guidelines for ascension. The highest of the 27 ranks is <i>Stiilran<\/i>, though no hunters of this class are known to exist during the time of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic\" title=\"The Galactic Republic\">The Galactic Republic<\/a>, <a href=\"/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire\" title=\"The Galactic Empire\">The Galactic Empire<\/a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p>It has long been rumored that some Jedi artifact, such as a temple or hidden tomb, lies somewhere in the Jiroch System.

With the exception of a few bands of rebels that hide in the world's mountains, all Chevs are slaves of the <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a>, the pachydermoid Species with whom they share the world. The Chev villages are all surrounded by mine fields and fences intended to protect the Chevs from predators and banish any thoughts of escape. <\/p>\n <p> Millennia ago, the Chevs lived in grand cities, but the more aggressive <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> shattered their peaceful civilization. Chev communities exist primarily to supply food and manufactured goods for their nomadic masters, although they are permitted to trade goods between villages. They have a rich culture, filled with folklore, a wide range of musical, dramatic, and artistic forms of expression, and religious traditions. The <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> have never made any effort to discourage the Chevs from practicing their cultural rites within the boundaries of their settlements, as the overlords find the activities interesting to watch and believe it helps increase the productivity of the slaves. Also, aspects of Chev religious beliefs exist that the <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> find suits their purposes- such as ancient myths describing how the Chevs would be enslaved as punishment for their pride in their great cities, Other beliefs are less appreciated by the <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a>- such as the tales that some day the Chevs will be delivered from their bondage and rise to rule all space- but the <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> are willing to take the bad with the good. Further, a number of <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> masters have discovered offworld markets for the more impressive Chev artistic works. Some <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> have even managed to sell Chev theater troupes at \"Group Rates.\" <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Unlike many other slave populations, the Chevs are well educated and as informed about the galaxy at large as their <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> masters, perhaps even more so. <\/p>\n <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> have always taken relatively good care of the Chevs because they believe healthy, bright, and happy slaves are more efficient than starved, illiterate and rebellious ones. The <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> pass virtually every bit of knowledge they gain about the galaxy at large, including technology- with the exception of repulsorlifts, comlinks, and weaponry- to their slaves. <\/p>\n <p>One drawback to the Chevin's permissive attitudes toward Chev culture, at least from the point of view of oppressive slave masters, is that they remain unaware of high-tech rebel movements within Chev villages. Like the <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a>, the Chevs take quickly to advanced technology and secretly build communications devices, jamming devices, sensors and weapons from parts stolen from farming equipment or <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> communities. Although the seeds of rebellion are first planted during the time of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic\" title=\"The Galactic Republic\">The Galactic Republic<\/a>, it isn't until <a href=\"/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era\" title=\"The New Jedi Order Era\">The New Jedi Order Era<\/a> that organized offworlders begin helping the Chevs expand their network of rebels. <\/p>\n <p>All Chevs encountered off <a class=\"new\" title=\"Vinsoth (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVmluc290aD9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\">Vinsoth<\/a> are either current or former slaves. When the Republic contacted the <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a>, they almost instantly started exporting their slave population, either to other slavers or to <a href=\"/wiki/Chevin\" title=\"Chevin\">Chevin<\/a> colonies offworld.

To some, the Ebruchi are a terror. To militarily superior forces, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Chiss\" title=\"Chiss\">Chiss<\/a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Vagaari\" title=\"Vagaari\">Vagaari<\/a>, the Ebruchi are a perpetual annoyance. <\/p>\n <p>The Ebruchi are omnivorous. They can survive on rotting garbage if necessary, but their appetites lean toward the sadistic. They love nothing more than swallowing the wet flesh of freshly killed prisoners. Their compact bulk makes them appear formidable despite their shorter than-average height, and the muscles are not just for show. An Ebruchi can take a terrific pounding, then return the favor. <\/p>\n <p>The Ebruchi style of dress matches their stereotype as uncivilized, opportunistic pirates. A typical outfit consists of layers of animal skins topped with shiny medallions, rings, or crowns. But those who think that an Ebruchi's appearance is lazily haphazard are mistaken. The Ebruchi put great thought into the placement of each item and layer, and all clothing is tended with exquisite care. Patches, scarves, necklaces, and intentional holes and tears are all signs of rank and achievement, although the nuances of the arrangements are lost on non-Ebruchi. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ebruchi_Characteristics\">Ebruchi Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> The Ebruchi are driven by the basest of emotions: greed and fear. Unwilling to give an edge to any other being-including members of their own Species-they overcompensate to the point of overkill. If a ship shows a hint of aggression, they will blast it to fragments; if a subordinate challenges their rank, they will retaliate with deadly force. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Still, the Ebruchi are not foolish, and they take such drastic actions only if they believe themselves to be safe from retaliation. This tendency, of course, makes them bullies of the worst stripe. The Ebruchi show no kindness unless they gain something in the process. They spare the lives of colonists only if the weaker beings provide tribute or possess some value as slaves or meat. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> The Ebruchi has a roughly humanoid configuration, with a squat, lumpy build similar to that of <a href=\"/wiki/Gands\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gands\">Gands<\/a>. Their grayish heads house two wide-set eyes that never blink and a hidden mouth ringed by writhing, fleshy feelers. These tentacles are always in motion as they sample airborne scents and can grasp chunks of food to force them down the Ebruchi's narrow gullet. This process is messy and, to most <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>, revolting. <\/p>\n <p>Male and female Ebruchi are nearly identical in appearance. Outsiders can distinguish them only because males and females usually wear different types of animal skins (Although determining the species of animal from it's fur is exceedingly difficult). It is best to employ gender-neutral pronouns when negotiating with the Ebruchi, for a mistaken identification of sex will be taken as a scandalous insult. <\/p>\n <p><b>Average Height/Weight:<\/b>&nbsp;A typical Ebruchi stands at 1.6 meters tall and weighs 45 kilograms. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Ebruchi age at the following stages: <\/p> \n <table class=\"wikitable\"> \n  <tbody>\n   <tr> \n    <th>CHILD <\/th> \n    <th>YOUNG ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>ADULT <\/th> \n    <th>MIDDLE AGE <\/th> \n    <th>OLD <\/th> \n    <th>VENERABLE <\/th>\n   <\/tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>1-7 Years <\/td> \n    <td>8-13 Years <\/td> \n    <td>14-39 Years <\/td> \n    <td>40-54 Years <\/td> \n    <td>55-64 Years <\/td> \n    <td>65+ Years <\/td>\n   <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n <\/table> \n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> The Ebruchi are ignorant of their origins.

As a Species, they are methodical researchers, careful observers, and considered among the best theoretical thinkers in the galaxy. Although well-versed in virtually every widely used technology in the galaxy, and often numbered among scientists who are on the cutting edge in a number of fields. Drall are primarily interested in abstract concepts and accumulating knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Therefore, despite the advanced nature of their scholarly pursuits, the world of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Drall (Planet) (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvRHJhbGxfKFBsYW5ldCk/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\">Drall<\/a> trails behind the rest of the galaxy in technological achievement, and the Drall themselves usually implement technology developed by others. For example, despite their having been part of the galactic community for over twenty millennia, the Drall still rely exclusively on spacefaring technology built by the Corellians.<\/p>\n <p>Drall society is a clan-based combination of a matriarch and a meritocracy. No elected or direct hereditary leaders exist on the Drall homeworld. Instead, each family heeds a \"Duchess,\" a female Drall who is deemed the most fit to lead. Once appointed, the Dutchess becomes the owner of all the family's property, and she holds the position for life or until she steps down and passes the title and property along to a suitable heir. Most of the Drall clans follow the overall direction set by the Dutchess of the most prosperous and powerful of all the clans. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Family life is also the most commonly discussed topic among Drall- exchanging gossip about one's family is a perfectly acceptable form of small talk. Drall find it surprising that other <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> may consider probing questions about family affairs an invasion of privacy, although once this is spelled out to them they quickly take steps to avoid offense. <\/p>\n <p>Most Drall who venture from their homeworld work for megacorporations as researchers or medical specialists- one of Drall's main exports, aside from scientific knowledge, is processed medicinal herbs- although a few also make good livings as information brokers. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drall_Characteristics\">Drall Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Drall take pride in being viewed as well mannered and considerate.

Deeply spiritual, they worship a broad pantheon of deities, the most senior of which is known as Quay. Zealous Weequay perform ritual sacrifices in Quay's honor, at times resorting to murder. Such incidents have done little to dispel their violent reputation. <\/p>\n <p>Each Weequay carries a spherical totem through which Quay allegedly speaks. The totem is used in times of great need to guide the Weequay, providing spiritual answers to individual questions. In practice, the Weequay asks a question, shakes the device, and waits for the answer to appear. A Weequay treats the totem's advice seriously and becomes angry and violent if such advice is questioned or ridiculed. <\/p>\n <p>Male Weequay ply the galaxy as thugs, mercenaries, and hired assassins, while female Weequay rarely, if ever, leave <a href=\"/wiki/Sriluur\" title=\"Sriluur\">Sriluur<\/a>. A Male Weequay who leaves Sriluur grows and cultivates a long braid, which is then shorn off upon his return to the homeworld in celebration.

For the entire period of the Galactic Empire, Neimoidian starports are under heavy Imperial control, and any efforts they make to reestablish their once-mighty trade networks are undermined at every turn. <\/p>\n <p>As a result, Neimoidian society turns inward in a self-imposed isolation that is as total as any they experienced during the millennia they spent as a \"Lost <a href=\"/wiki/Duros\" title=\"Duros\">Duros<\/a> Colony.\" The Neimoidians remain isolationists through the Legacy era, and the few Neimoidians that wander beyond their home space are usually on the run from enemies at home and passing themselves off as <a href=\"/wiki/Duros\" title=\"Duros\">Duros<\/a>. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Neimoidian_Characteristics\">Neimoidian Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Neimoidians are greedy and cowardly, always striving to acquire just one more credit but trying to make sure that someone else takes whatever risks are associated with getting it.

Young Kitonak are educated through epic songs that pass knowledge from generation to generation. <\/p>\n <p>Kitonak who are encountered off their homeworld are usually freed slaves. When the Species' homeworld was first discovered by scouts a few decades prior to the rise of the Empire, a number of enterprising slave traders thought the Kitonak's unique musical performances would make them interesting additions to the households of wealthy crime lords and shady senators. However, the unwillingness of the Kitonak to adhere to anyone's pace but their own (Even in the face of threats of violence and death) led to their execution, abandonment, or release. Some masters attempted to recoup the purchase price of their useless slaves by making the Kitonak pay for their freedom. Most of these Kitonak found work as musicians, and the merging of galactic popular music and the music of Kitonak society led to the rise of several innovative music styles during the turbulent Rebellion Era. <\/p>\n <p>A number of Kitonak were recruited as spies for <a href=\"/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance<\/a> during the Galactic Civil War.

They are very steadfast in the face of any opposition. The only things they are truly afraid of are quicksand and caves- quicksand because it represents a slow and painful death for a Kitonak who only has to breathe every few hours, and caves because Kitonak legends claim they are gateways to the Realm of the Dead. <\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b>&nbsp;Kitonak are humanoids with sturdy legs and thick arms that end in pudgy fingers.

The coastal cities of their homeworld are constructed to allow the rising tides to flood the buildings. When this takes place, Chagrians swim from place to place, or use speeders, which are adapted for aquatic use. The pleasant tropical climate of <a href=\"/wiki/Champala\" title=\"Champala\">Champala<\/a>, coupled with the exotic architecture of it's cities makes the Chagrian homeworld a popular destination for galactic tourists. Unlike cities, spaceports on <a href=\"/wiki/Champala\" title=\"Champala\">Champala<\/a> are built high above sea level, on the direst parcels of land. <\/p>\n <p>Although juvenile Chagrians possess a weak sense of taste, this sense fades as they mature into adults. The end result is that Chagrians rarely, if ever, enjoy consuming food and drink, and do so solely to fuel their bodies. Dining activities are traditionally viewed as a nuisance, and a waste of time, so most Chagrians choose to consume nutrient capsules in order to maintain bodily heath and energy levels. When traveling, most Chagrians carry portable scanners that allow them to determine the relative nutrient value of the food they eat. Although they are unable to taste the food they eat, Chagrians view dining as an opportunity to socialize with members of other <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> that do not share their sensory deficiencies. <\/p>\n <p>Society on <a href=\"/wiki/Champala\" title=\"Champala\">Champala<\/a> is peaceful and highly structured, although Chagrian legal systems are complex and often daunting to outsiders. As a rule, Chagrians are law-abiding and obedient toward figures of authority. Chagrian government ensures that every citizen is cared for, and the standard of living for even the poorest Chagrian is quite high when compared to the impoverished members of other <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p>Chagrians have inherited an innate resistance to <a href=\"/wiki/Radiation\" title=\"Radiation\">Radiation<\/a> due to instability in <a href=\"/wiki/Champala\" title=\"Champala\">Champala's<\/a> primary star. Their blue skin is a direct result of this evolutionary step, and modern Chagrians continue to enjoy protection from myriad forms of <a href=\"/wiki/Radiation\" title=\"Radiation\">Radiation<\/a> as a side effect. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chagrian_Characteristics\">Chagrian Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality: <\/b>Chagrians are, by and large, even-tempered and accepting of others.

They assume that others behave in a similar fashion, and few things anger a Herglic more than deceit and cheating. <\/p>\n <p>Herglics are risk-takers, both by nature and by ancient cultural tradition. They love meeting new beings and experiencing the sights and sounds of new places.

However, Herglics become increasingly marginalized as decadence, corruption, and greed take hold of the galactic government at virtually every level. <\/p>\n <p>Many consider the Herglics to be cowards and traitors to the people of the galaxy, and they are viewed with contempt in many quarters even a century after the fall of Emperor Palpatine. But the Herglics are happy to be in a position to help devastated worlds rebuild by supplying them with high quality goods at fair prices. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Herglic_Characteristics\">Herglic Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Herglics are so easy-going and gregarious that they drive more high-strung beings, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Ubese\" title=\"Ubese\">Ubese<\/a>, to distraction. Herglics love interacting and socializing with others, and they are often very generous when it comes to sharing wealth and good fortune. Anyone in need usually finds his or her Herglic friends among the first to offer assistance. Their helpful nature causes many Herglics to fall victim to petty con artists, but professional criminals know that when a Herglic feels betrayed, he or she will go to great lengths to take revenge. More than one small-time swindler has been stalked by top bounty hunters after taking advantage of the wrong Herglic. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Members of the Species also crave excitement-in fact, many Herglics become addicted to thrill seeking. This often manifests as a tendency to <a href=\"/wiki/Gamble\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gamble\">Gamble<\/a> to excess; only a strong-willed Herglic can pass up a game of chance. Once they start to <a href=\"/wiki/Gamble\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gamble\">Gamble<\/a>, they do not stop unless forced to quit, and a Herglic can easily lose everything- including the clothes off his or her back- in a short time by betting in the wrong casinos.

In fact, Herglics are so large that they cannot fit through doorways or corridors built with less massive beings in mind. Virtually all ships piloted by Herglics are either specially constructed or extensively modified at shipyards operated by their Species. <\/p>\n <p>Herglic bodies are hairless, and their skin ranges from a deep blue-gray to a black that is darker than the depths of space. Some Herglics have white bellies or white stripes that run up the sides of their bodies and terminate at their large, heavily lidded eyes.

The Ranth have learned to track time by studying the paths of these two satellites. <\/p>\n <p>Sometime in their distant past, the primitive Ranth split into two distinct societies. The first group formed permanent communities atop the planet's great drifting glaciers, slowly advancing toward a sophisticated industrial civilization with a formal government, an interest in galactic affairs, and cavernous ice cities displaying wondrous architecture. The second group remained nomadic and savage by comparison. Roaming in small tribes, these Ranth lack the technology of their more settled counterparts, relying on tireless beasts of burden and their keen predatory instincts to survive. For the most part, the Civilized Ranth and Nomadic Ranth avoid one another, as almost every encounter between the two ends in violence and bloodshed.<\/p>\n <p>Both Civilized and Nomadic Ranth maintain strong family ties, as each family carries forward it's own traditions, history, and set of values (Often dictated by the family's elder). Civilized Ranth have extensive contact with the rest of the galaxy, adapting to the latest trends. Nomadic Ranth war fur and leather garments made from the hides of slain beasts, tend to fear offworlders, and work to undermine the Civilized Ranth society. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>The Empire occupied the Ranth homeworld for a time. Imperial agents searching for secret Rebel bases encountered the Ranth instead. The Civilized Ranth accepted Imperial rule without a struggle, benefiting from the introduction of new technology and regarding the Empire as a symbol of great achievement and promise. The Nomadic Ranth were far less enamored with the Empire. They attacked Imperial patrols and mining stations before vanishing into the icy wastelands. Unable to track the Nomadic Ranth, the Imperials turned to the Civilized Ranth for assistance. The city-dwellers followed the directive without question, leading to many open conflicts among the Civilized and Nomadic Ranth. <\/p>\n <p>Imperial engineers changed the face of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Caaraz (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvQ2FhcmF6P2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\">Caaraz<\/a> with strip-mining, construction, and pollution. With the Empire's defeat, the Civilized Ranth took control of the abandoned Imperial mining installations and processing facilities. Since then, conditions on the planet have deteriorated. Mining facilities have become makeshift cities overpopulated with Ranth that had enjoyed unfettered protection from predators under Imperial rule. The resulting population explosion has left these Ranth impoverished. <\/p>\n <p>The Nomadic Ranth continue to mount attacks against Civilized Ranth communities. Meanwhile, the Civilized Ranth strive to push their primitive brethren deeper into the icy wastelands, where they can pose no threat.

Although they enjoy being part of the galactic community, the Species has contributed precious little to its advancement. The Krish allow their preoccupation with various cultural pastimes to interfere with their work, and they allow self-interest to rule their lives. Krish officials are often corrupt, treating politics as any other game and a means to gain personal prestige and power. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p>Krish look for ways to focus their natural aggression. They love to play games and solve convoluted puzzles, and they watch just about every sport in the galaxy. Highly competitive, they prefer a challenge to \"An Easy Kill\" (A common Krish metaphor for any sort of mismatch). For instance, a Krish bounty hunter will give weak quarry every conceivable advantage to keep the hunt challenging. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Krish_Characteristics\">Krish Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b>&nbsp;Krish are cunning, fearless, unscrupulous, and easily goaded.

In addition to learning the traditions and ways of their particular caste-clans, Sludir children were taught to respect the code of battle. Combat became the true test of a Sludir's character.

Despite this proclamation, the Species' planet of origin remains uncertain.

Some attribute the Species' relative scarcity on their solitary nature and the lack of any established Rybet settlement. Also to blame is the Species' gender opposition: Rybet males inexplicably detest Rybet females. (The reverse is true of the female of the Species.) Only an overwhelming compulsion to reproduce can overcome the males, fear and loathing of Rybet females. Rybets feel a drive to reproduce every 10 years of their adult lives. <\/p>\n <p>Females lay a clutch of between three and eight eggs. A Rybet couple stays together for a year or two, typically slaving their ships together and each taking part in the early rearing of the children. Eventually, however, they start to grate on each other's nerves: if the male doesn't leave of his own accord, he often ends up dead or maimed. Rybet children mature swiftly. By the age of five, they are ready to attempt to make their way in the galaxy. A Rybet mother who slays the father typically sells his ship, giving her young the proceeds with which to start their lives.

Skin colors range from bright green to deep olive, with faint ochre stripes along their cheeks. Their eyes are bulbous and lantern-like, with upper and lower eyelids that close across the center of the eye.

A number of the smaller tentacles actually optic stalks, the Ergesh equivalent of eyes, while others are sensitive to sound waves. <\/p>\n <p>When Ergesh get angry, they quake and begin to make gargling noises. They are poor combatants, their most effective attack is to simply trample over their opponents. Due to their massive bulk (An adult Ergesh weighs half a metric ton), this crude tactic is extremely effective against foes <a href=\"/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a>-sized and smaller. The major drawback of this attack is that the Ergesh must be close to their opponent to begin with, as they are not swift enough to catch a fleeing foe. <\/p>\n <p>Once per year, there comes a day when both moons are aligned in a certain way, with devastating effects on the Ergesh. During this period, the Ergesh act irrational, violent, even insane. It is almost as if the Ergesh are intoxicated. This day is called he \"Bad Water Pull,\" and all offworlders are encouraged to stay clear of the native population until the madness passes. <\/p>\n <p>Ergesh are divided into clans, which have formed a federation that rules the planet.

The Ergesh federation has ties with <a href=\"/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance<\/a>, and occasionally harbors Rebel fugitives. <\/p>\n <p>The Ergesh specialize in organic machines, most of them \"Grown\" in the area called the \"Industrial Swampfields.\" Ergesh machinery is a fusion of plant matter and manufactured materials. This equipment cannot be deprived of moisture for more than one standard hour, or it ceases to function properly. Even Ergesh buildings are organic, and some are semi-sentient. No locks are needed on the dilating doors because the buildings know who they belong to. Ergesh buildings have ramps instead of stairs- indeed, stairs are unheard of, and there is no such word in the native language. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ergesh_Characteristics\">Ergesh Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Ergesh are boisterous, curious, and rather naive.

Its body is covered with drooping, slimy appendages that range from two centimeters to three meters in length, and from one millimeter to five centimeters in width.

Their reclusiveness is a blessing, for if the Sorcerers of Rhand were to unleash the full entropic power of what they call The Dark, the entire galaxy might come to ruin. <\/p>\n <p>The Sorcerers or Rhand are realists. They understand that the power of destruction, coupled with time, has more ability to change the universe than any effort of creation. They devote their efforts to understanding its purpose and ultimately divining a way to become agents of The Dark. By manipulating the forces of destruction, they can bring their enemies to ruin. <\/p>\n <p>The Sorcerers do not care about the traditions of the Jedi and the Sith. The idea of a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Force\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Force\">Force<\/a>\" with a <a href=\"/wiki/Light_Side\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Light Side\">Light Side<\/a> and a <a href=\"/wiki/Dark_Side\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dark Side\">Dark Side<\/a> strikes them as quaint and naïve. When they tap into The Dark, they are not communicating with an energy field created by living things (By definition, a fleeting, transitory trifle) but with the fundamental law of reality. <\/p>\n <p>According to Succate's annals, the Sorcerers are the culmination of three ancient philosophical schools. The first is the Knell of Muspilli, a death cult from the moon trees of the Gunninga Gap that transcribed the Taurannix Codex to call forth apocalyptic deities from beyond the Gap's spatial fissure. <\/p>\n <p>The second school is the Kanzer Exiles, a fanatical flock of reptilians led by the Lord Ravager Korman Lao. These exiles expanded their faith through mental enslavement and built a world-sized temple near the Valtaullu Rift. <\/p>\n <p>The third school is an offshoot of the Warriors of the Shadow-Taung soldiers beaten by the Battalions of Zhell in the prehistory of <a href=\"/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a>. After surviving the war and a volcanic plume of ash that filled the skies for two years, the priestly sisterhood of the Taungs fled to the Unknown Regions to seek atonement through meditation and insight. <\/p>\n <p>Thousands of years bring about the merging of these belief systems on the worlds of the Nihil Retreat near the Perann Nebula.

According to her recounting of a meeting in the central ruin of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Rhand (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvUmhhbmQ/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\">Rhand<\/a>, each Sorcerer manifests in a unique state of disassembly and decay. One lacked skin and oozed bodily fluids with every step. One was merely a blackened skeleton. Another appeared to have been turned inside out, with clean white teeth poking jaggedly from a raw mass of a head. A fourth existed as a long ribbon of flesh that swirled and coiled throughout the Rhandite receiving chamber. <\/p>\n <p>Succate could not determine whether these were mortal beings that had been transformed into such states, supernatural entities that had taken strange forms, or simply illusions. But despite their unsettling appearance, the presence of additional black-cloaked figures hovering on the periphery engendered even more dread- for Succate's imagination conjured even worse horrors that might lie beneath their black folds. <\/p>\n <p>Most Sorcerers of Rhand appear to walk on two legs, but some hover above the ground at a height of half a meter, the hems of their robes dangling above the cold stone. Others have four or more legs and scuttle close to the floor with heavy blankets draped over their backs. A few rare members of the order flap high above their gatherings on wings, unwilling or unable to descend to ground level. Meeting an assemblage of Sorcerers is a disorienting and sometimes terrifying experience. <\/p>\n <p><b>Average Height/Weight:<\/b>&nbsp;Due to their corrupted physiology, a Sorcerer of Rhand has no typical height or weight. <\/p>\n <p><b><a href=\"/wiki/Age_Groups\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age Groups\">Age Groups<\/a>:<\/b>&nbsp;Due to their varied origins and Force corruption, Sorcerers of Rhand are not affected by the effects of <a href=\"/wiki/Aging\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Aging\">Aging<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p><b>Homeworld:<\/b> The reclusive Sorcerers have never been spotted definitively outside the twelve star clusters of the <a class=\"new\" title=\"Nihil Retreat (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvTmloaWxfUmV0cmVhdD9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\">Nihil Retreat<\/a> that form a protective bulwark around the <a class=\"new\" title=\"Perann Nebula (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvUGVyYW5uX05lYnVsYT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\">Perann Nebula<\/a>, with their true home being the mysterious planet of <a class=\"new\" title=\"Rhand (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvUmhhbmQ/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\">Rhand<\/a>.

Even then, the Chiss remain an enigmatic, secretive <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. Their origins are largely unknown, even to the Chiss themselves, though some scientists believe they are descended from an isolated <a href=\"/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> colony lost to time. <\/p>\n <p>The Chiss are technologically advanced, keenly interested in art and science, and skilled at mathematics. Though logical in their mindset, they are also appreciative of philosophy, and interested in other cultures. Given their xenophobic tendencies, it comes as no surprise that the Chiss use their understanding of non-Chiss cultures to gain a tactical advantage over potential adversaries. <\/p>\n <p>Chiss society is highly ordered and structured. Rule of law is controlled and enforced by a small number of ruling \"Families.\" These ruling families, also known as clans or houses, are more akin to different branches of government than to actual familial units. As a rule, a Chiss will never knowingly do anything to bring shame upon his or her family, for entire lines have been exiled for the actions of a single family member. <\/p>\n <p>The culture of the Chiss is based on a strict code of conduct. As a rule, they do not attack an opponent unless they are attacked first. Thrawn ignores this imperative when he sizes control of the Imperial remnants, and consequently he is exiled from his people. Although most Chiss are peaceful, once embroiled in military conflict, they do not relent until their opponents are either totally destroyed, or completely subjugated. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chiss_Characteristics\">Chiss Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality: <\/b>Many of the galaxy's perceptions of the Chiss and how they behave is initially based on the personality of Grand Admiral Thrawn.

The moon has a highly unusual cycle of light and dark, sometimes illuminated brightly and other times shrouded in complete darkness. To compensate for these uncertain conditions, Gotals evolved special cones atop their heads that sense subtle shifts in the electromagnetic field, allowing them to operate in light or dark without hindrance. The cones are sensitive enough to sense not only the presence of living creatures nearby but also a creature's mood or intent. <\/p>\n <p>Emotions are an important part of Gotal culture. Young Gotals live in a constant state of confusion as they are bombarded by the emotions of others. Learning to handle this input is what pushes a Gotal toward adulthood and maturity. Adult Gotals are calm, almost serene beings, but despite their outward appearance, they feel the full breadth of emotions. Because they are so sensitive to emotions, Gotals quickly form meaningful relationships with one another. Gotals prefer to be around their own kind and dislike <a href=\"/wiki/Droids\" title=\"Droids\">Droids<\/a>, mainly because the electromagnetic fields produced by <a href=\"/wiki/Droids\" title=\"Droids\">Droids<\/a> cause an irritating buzz perceptible to the Gotals' heightened senses. <\/p>\n <p>Gotals learned long ago to keep their opinions to themselves, and thus they make excellent negotiators and diplomats. Some individuals, however, use their natural abilities for nefarious purposes and become assassins or bounty hunters, tracking their prey by the emotional trail it broadcasts. Most <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> appreciate the self-discipline that Gotals exhibit, but some are hesitant to associate with members of the Species for fear of having their private passions and motivations revealed. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gotal_Characteristics\">Gotal Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p> \n <p><b>Personality:<\/b> Because they can read the emotions of other beings, Gotals have learned to be extremely polite and discreet with the information that they glean. They keep their own emotions to themselves and speak to others in neutral terms to maintain civility. Indeed, Gotals are incapable of expressing emotions in words, relying on their cones to communicate their feelings to other Gotals. As a result, Gotals speak only in abstract terms, leading most other sentients to think they are emotionless beings. <\/p>\n <p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"><\/p>\n <p><b>Physical Description:<\/b> Gotals are tall creatures with flat, elongated faces.

Their society is organized around \"Dens.\" Each Den lives in an underground commune, that consists of one fertile female (Called the \"Queen\"), a few fertile males, and a large number of sterile females. Within the Den exist sub-groups called \"Septs\"- offspring fathered by the same fertile male- and each Sept is usually trained to perform specific tasks and jobs. A Queen can be pregnant up to five times each year, each time giving birth to five or more children. Sterile females fill most roles in Selonian society, while the Queens and males are kept safely in the Dens. Selonian \"Cities\" are actually collections of several Dens, each of which primarily specializes in a skill or craft. These Dens aid and support each other through a complicated system of bartering and favor exchanges. <\/p>\n <p>Selonians are primarily concerned with the safety of their Dens, and their people as a whole. Almost without fail, they believe that the needs of the group are more important than the desires of an individual, and every action they take is intended to further the goals of their Den, or the welfare of their <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> in general.<\/p>\n <p>Despite their seemingly primitive society, Selonian technology is on par with the galactic standard; their Dens are linked through computer networks and rapid transit systems, and their industrial production capacity helps feed the ravenous Corellian Engineering Shipyards with high-tech components. Selonians have also long been masters of their own <a href=\"/wiki/Starship\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Starship\">Starship<\/a> technology, building vessels that carry them throughout the <a href=\"/wiki/Corellian_System\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Corellian System\">Corellian System<\/a>.

They were swept up in power struggles that followed the collapse of Imperial rule in the <a href=\"/wiki/Corellian_System\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Corellian System\">Corellian System<\/a>, and faced the very real possibility that their world would be destroyed. This has caused the Selonians to withdraw from most interactions with other cultures even within the <a href=\"/wiki/Corellian_System\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Corellian System\">Corellian System<\/a>. However, the shock so unsettled Selonian society that some rare Selonians began trying to change their culture, so they can deal more honestly with other <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. <\/p> \n <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Selonian_Characteristics\">Selonian Characteristics<\/span><\/h3> \n <p><b>Personality: <\/b>Most Selonians prefer to remain on their homeworld, and don't care to interact with other <a href=\"/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>.

As years passed the old supply grew smaller, and <a href=\"/wiki/Droid_Manufacturers\" title=\"Droid Manufacturers\">Droid Manufacturers<\/a> began experimenting with (And eventually producing) new Combat Droids. <\/p>\n <p>Although there are always those willing to employ cheap brute force, the stigma of most Clone Wars-era Military Droids made them unpopular choices as soon as new options came along.
