Even then, the meetings take place aboard their ships. In recent history, the Aing-Tii are known to patrol the space known as the Kathol Rift and do not interact very much with the inhabitants of the region. <\/p><p>By the end of the Clone Wars, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Jedi Order\">The Jedi Order<\/a> learns of The Aing-Tii Monks' existence and knows that the Aing-Tii are decidedly uninterested in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi\" title=\"The Jedi\">The Jedi<\/a>. A few years before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, Master Yoda sends a former smuggler named Jorj Car'das to the Aing-Tii to ask for their help in countering his failing health. The Monks agree to assist on the condition that Jorj stays with them to learn their ways. Several years pass before the Monks allow Jorj Car'das to leave their company and spend the rest of his life on Exocron, a world in the Kathol Outback. <\/p><p>Four years after the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a>, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Aing-Tii_Monks\" title=\"The Aing-Tii Monks\">The Aing-Tii Monks<\/a> begin a search for what they call the Codex, an ancient piece of Darkstryder technology they believe to be sacred. Convinced that they cannot physically touch it, they abduct a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> navigator named Makezh, erase his memories, and implant a subconscious command to seek out and obtain the Codex for them. The Monks' knowledge of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> physiology is limited, however, and Makezh becomes mildly insane as a result of the operation. The search concludes on the planet <span class=\"new\" title=\"Demonsgate (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvRGVtb25zZ2F0ZT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\">Demonsgate<\/span>, a lone world beyond the Kathol Rift.

If it seems reasonable that a given Droid might be capable of an action similar to an existing ability, allow the action to proceed with a lesser chance of success and/or a lesser result than could be gained with the existing ability.<\/li> \n <li><b>Is the request likely to be abused by the player in future sessions, or likely to become exploited regularly?<\/b> If not, allow the idea to be used at least in this instance. However, if the idea could become an unwelcome addition to future sessions, the Gamemaster can avoid denying its use outright by allowing the character to spend a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Force Point\">Force Point<\/a> or a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny_Point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destiny Point\">Destiny Point<\/a> (if appropriate) for the action.

If the ability seems like something a Droid ought to be able to learn, create a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feat\">Feat<\/a>. If the ability seems focused on a trademark task of a particular model or degree of Droid, create a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Talent\">Talent<\/a> specific to that degree of Droid.<\/li>\n  <\/ul><\/li> \n <li><b>Adjudicating simple and complex tasks.<\/b> If the Gamemaster decides to proceed with the request, he or she should decide what actions, attacks, and skill checks are required for success. Simple tasks are typically covered by one skill check, but unique circumstances might require more time and/or multiple checks. Complex tasks should take multiple rounds with multiple checks.<\/li> \n <li><b>Plan for failure.<\/b> A Droid that performs a task outside its realm of expertise can make for potentially amusing or unexpected situations if it fails. The Droid might become confused, carry out the next operation without completing the first task, return unexpectedly, call on the owner for clarified instructions, or give up and report the failure. In the middle of a battle or a critical mission, this failure can cause confusion or threaten a mission's success, forcing the heroes to act quickly to resolve the situation. Gamemasters should take advantage of this potentially dramatic or amusing situation.<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Droid_that_Gained_levels\">The Droid that Gained levels<\/span><\/h3><p>In adventuring parties featuring less than five players, adding a Gamemaster-controlled Droid to the party can be a great way to balance the party without having to adjust your encounter design. Many gaming groups can only muster three or four players and a Gamemaster, while the game is designed for a typical group of five players and a GM. Filling those empty player spots with Droids is a nice option, because a Droid can easily fade into the background during noncombat encounters, whereas a living character that does so might seem shallow and one-dimensional. If you decide to include a Droid ally as a means of filling out the party's numbers, you should probably think about the Droid just like you would any other major Gamemaster character, and plan on it being with the party for the duration of the campaign. <\/p><p>You should choose a Droid Model that fills an appropriate niche in the party. Similarly, you should probably think about the kinds of adventures your heroes are going to be going on, and what roles need to be filled. If the party lacks a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)\" title=\"Pilot (Vehicle Combat)\">Pilot<\/a>, a Pilot Droid seems like a good choice. However, there are other considerations. Some Droids don't do well on adventures due to their forms (try getting that <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wheeled\" title=\"Wheeled\">Wheeled<\/a> Droid up a long set of stairs). A good option for creating Droids to round out a party of heroes is to use a stock <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid_Chassis\" title=\"Droid Chassis\">Droid Chassis<\/a> and then build the Droid from the ground up. This not only lets you build exactly the kind of Droid you need to fill a gap in the party, it unshackles you from the usual physical forms of various Droids. <\/p><p>As the heroes gain levels, so should the Droid. The levels you choose for your Droid should likewise continue to help the Droid fill in the gaps in the party. If the party is short on firepower, the Droid should take levels with a high <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Base Attack Bonus\">Base Attack Bonus<\/a> and good combat <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents\" title=\"Talents\">Talents<\/a>. However, you also have another option to consider. If you want the Droid to grow and to develop as an interesting Gamemaster character, consider having the Droid take levels in the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Independent_Droid\" title=\"Independent Droid\">Independent Droid<\/a> Prestige Class. This helps represent the fact that the Droid is becoming more and more unique thanks to its time with a party of heroes at the center of great, galaxy-shaking events. <\/p>"

Although they have been part of galactic civilization for millennia, very few Umbarans have left their home system, and even fewer have risen to positions of power and fame in the galaxy. Umbarans are interested in alien cultures and civilizations, but they prefer to observe from a distance rather than take an active role in events. <\/p><p>During the rise of the Empire, the Umbarans spend a few decades moving through the halls of supreme political power. An Umbaran named Sly Moore serves as Palpatine's chief aide during his later years as Chancellor of the Republic and the earliest period of his reign as Emperor. Moore's prominence in galactic politics causes her to be so admired on her homeworld that she inspires other Umbarans to venture out into the rest of the galaxy. Many of them join Moore on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a>, and soon Umbarans are a common sight on that world. <\/p><p>As Palpatine's New Order becomes increasingly biased toward <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humans\">Humans<\/a>, Moore vanishes from the Emperor's side and moves into more shadowy roles within his government. From deep within the intelligence apparatus, she and other Umbarans lead efforts to root out anyone who is not unquestionably loyal to Emperor Palpatine, and they answer only to the Emperor. They are so effective that even Emperor Palpatine's most dedicated followers grow to fear them, something that strengthens the antialien sentiment among many of the Emperor's closest advisers. The Umbarans are particularly disliked by officers of Imperial Intelligence, who resent the fact that they are subject to Umbaran scrutiny- a resentment that grows every time the Umbarans unmask a Rebel double agent in their ranks. <\/p><p>After the death of Emperor Palpatine and the collapse of his government, the Umbarans find themselves under threat from the Rebels they had hunted and the New Order supporters they had intimidated. When former head of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard forges a powerful coalition on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant\" title=\"Coruscant\">Coruscant<\/a> dedicated to reestablishing a strong Galactic Empire, the remaining Umbarans flee the planet, knowing that Isard will seek brutal revenge for the embarrassments they caused her organization when she was rising through the ranks of Imperial Intelligence. <\/p><p>Even before the fall of the Empire, however, Umbarans already begin to retreat from the galaxy. As the full scope of Emperor Palpatine's evil becomes more evident and knowledge of the atrocities committed in his name more widespread, the Umbarans grow embarrassed over Moore's association with the Emperor, and they resume their reclusive ways. In fact, they withdraw even more fully than before, fearing retribution from the many <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> surrounding them. <\/p><p>As memories of the Empire start to fade in the minds of the galaxy's beings, Umbarans begin to filter back out into the galaxy in the low numbers typical of their off-world presence during the Old Republic. <\/p>"

Entire city-states were captured en masse by raiders, and transported to other worlds to work as slaves. Even when the Old Republic outlawed the practice, it continued, with Ugnaught communities \"Immigrating,\" and paying off the cost by working as \"Indentured Servants.\" Due to their hardiness, Ugnaughts were particularly sought-after by operators of mining operations, and they enjoy a well-deserved reputation as expert miners who can extract ore and gases from even the most impossible locations. <\/p><p>While many Ugnaughts in the galaxy are the descendants of slaves, a number of them are members of tribes who left their homeworld as legitimate immigrants, such as the tens of thousands of Ugnaughts in the Cloud City of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bespin\" title=\"Bespin\">Bespin<\/a>, working as laborers and mining <span class=\"new\" title=\"Tibanna Gas (page does not exist)\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVGliYW5uYV9HYXM/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\">Tibanna Gas<\/span>.

                "description": "<p><br> When the Yinchorr System was first charted five centuries before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, explorers found it resource-poor and unworthy of colonization. Further, the Yinchorri were deemed too primitive to be any great boon to the Republic. So, they were largely ignored until a year before the Invasion of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo\" title=\"Naboo\">Naboo<\/a>, when they officially joined the Republic. They gained interstellar travel capabilities, most likely from stolen technology, shortly after their admission into the Galactic Senate. <\/p><p>Slavers quickly learned to avoid the Yinchorr System, as the Yinchorri made terrible slaves- they tended to fight to the death rather than be enslaved, while individuals were so uncooperative that they either starved themselves to death or had to be put down. <\/p><p>Until shortly before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a>, the Yinchorri lived in city states, with each community fielding its own any and having its own leaders, usually a Council of Elders. Each city-state had a number of satellite communities that grew food and mined resources for the central city, and a city's power was measured by how many smaller settlements are needed to keep it supplied. For many centuries, Tol-Kachorn was the mightiest of ail Yinchorri city-states, with nearly one hundred villages and five other cities and attendant communities under its rule. Other cities occasionally tried to equal or rival Tol-Kachorn, which led to brutal campaigns of conquest. Followed by widespread chaos in the region once the emerging empire collapsed. <\/p><p>The Yinchorri initially went unnoticed and undisturbed by the Emperor's New Order; as the system contained few resources, no one felt the need to call attention to the obstinate Species that dwelled there. The one exception- and one of Yinchorr's greatest tragedies- was when the system's Imperial governor decided the Yinchorri could serve as the perfect bait in a plot to capture Princess Leia (and advance his career past a dead-end posting ln a useless star system). He captured the leaders of the various Yinchorri Councils of Elders and offered to trade their lives back to the Yinchorri in exchange for Leia. The Yinchorri people felt that the life of one <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> was an adequate price for their beloved eiders, so they set a trap for the Rebel leader. When the governor tried to double-cross the Yinchorri, the angry natives overthrew him and his regime. <\/p><p>After becoming fully aware of the evil of the Empire, the Tol-Kachorn Council of Elders threw their support behind <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance\" title=\"The Rebel Alliance\">The Rebel Alliance<\/a>. As the Rebellion established bases in the Yinchorr System, other Yinchorri city-states offered their warriors and Starships to the fight as well. <\/p><p>The Empire punished the Yinchorri for their revolt. The sector's Moff, with the full blessing of the Imperial High Command, ordered a massive assault against <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yinchorr\" title=\"Yinchorr\">Yinchorr<\/a>, and shortly after the fall of Echo Base on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hoth\" title=\"Hoth\">Hoth<\/a>, the Rebel bases in the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yinchorr\" title=\"Yinchorr\">Yinchorr<\/a> system were leveled. The cities of Yinchorri were also pounded to rubble by orbital bombardments- even the long history of mighty Tol-Kachorn ended that day. The surviving Yinchorri were reduced to living as nomadic tribes. The devastation on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yinchorr\" title=\"Yinchorr\">Yinchorr<\/a> came to the Emperor's personal attention a few months later, and shortly before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Endor\">Endor<\/a> he ordered all training facilities of his elite personal guard to be consolidated in that system. <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yinchorr\" title=\"Yinchorr\">Yinchorr<\/a> remained under Imperial domination until nearly a decade after the destruction of the Yinchorri cities; the system was liberated by New Republic forces as part of the campaign to reclaim the territory seized by the forces led by what was reportedly the Emperor's clone. <\/p><p>The surviving Yinchorri came together under the banner of the last son of the leader of Tol-Kachorn's Elder Council. They have since settled in the heavily defended complex once used as the headquarters of the Emperor's Imperial Guard and are currently trying to rebuild their civilization. Yinchorr remains an independent star system into <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era\" title=\"The New Jedi Order Era\">The New Jedi Order Era<\/a>. While the system continues to host a New Republic military base and a small Starship repair facility, the Yinchorri have not yet applied for membership in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic\" title=\"The New Republic\">The New Republic<\/a>. <\/p><p>From the moment they hatch, the Yinchorri join tightly knit, highly supportive communities- first their parents and clutchmates, later the entire village they grow up in, then their professional peers and superiors, and finally, a family of their own. When a Yinchorri mates, he or she does so for life, and it is quite common for a widowed individual to die from sorrow within a few days of losing his or her spouse. While the Yinchorri have taken to space travel, few have settled off their homeworld. Those who have, however have brought their entire extended family with them, essentially transplanting entire villages at a time. <\/p>"

Genetic sampling has confirmed a few tenuous biological links, though the exact evolutionary process by which the Pau'an Species developed separately from the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Utai\" title=\"Utai\">Utai<\/a> is still a mystery. Xenoanthropologists date the first Pau'an civilizations back almost 57,000 years before the Battle of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yavin\">Yavin<\/a>, making theirs one of the youngest known civilizations. Though no written history of this time exists, scientists currently theorize that the long-lived Pau'ans are genetically closer to their progenitor Species, and that as a result of their longevity the Pau'ans have likely only evolved a little since the planet was settled. <\/p><p>Some time in the last ten thousand years, <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Utapau\" title=\"Utapau\">Utapau<\/a> underwent a climate change that caused winds on the surface of the world to reach and maintain constant bursts at destructive speeds. Experts from the University of Sanbra speculate that the climate change was likely very sudden (At least, sudden in geological terms) given the fact that the Pau'an Species did not evolve or adapt to the high winds as many other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> did. The long gap between Pau'an generations caused by their extremely long lives was probably responsible for this evolutionary stumbling block, and were it not for the migration of Pau'an civilization underground they might not have survived the climate change. <\/p><p>The shift to life underground did not change the Species' eating habits, as they maintained many of the biological signs of a carnivorous diet. The ecology of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Utapau\" title=\"Utapau\">Utapau<\/a>, particularly with regard to an abundance of animal life in sinkholes and below ground, allowed the Pau'ans to retain their carnivorous ways, which persist into modern times. <\/p>"

When the Republic first visited <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Elom_(Planet)\" title=\"Elom (Planet)\">Elom<\/a> a century before the rise of the Empire, the Elomin were divided into separate political nations, used internal combustion engines and slug-throwing weaponry, and were barely able to launch satellites into orbit. Blasters, repulsorlifts, and Starships were beyond anything the Elomin had ever imagined. They took quickly to the advanced technology the first-contact specialists chose to share with them.

In all three major <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eras_of_Play\" title=\"Eras of Play\">Eras of Play<\/a>, most worlds located at trade-route junctions have at least one Arcona colony, and Arcona can be found at virtually every large spaceport- either as travelers or operators of businesses. <\/p><p>While most beings consider Arcona cities on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a> quality low-tech, the planet has several impressive starports, and many of the galaxy's mining companies operate on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a>.

Water is the most precious substance on <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a>, so the Arcona sold the mining rights to the firms for massive shipments of water. Although the Arcona derive many essential nutrients directly from the world's atmosphere, they also need to consume water and other liquids to keep secondary circulatory systems in their bodies healthy. (This has led some planetary geologists to hypothesize that <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cona\" title=\"Cona\">Cona<\/a> lost much of its water in some geologically recent catastrophe, though this remains unproven.) <\/p><p>When it was discovered the Arcona can easily and hopelessly become addicted to sodium chloride (salt) by ingesting even a gram or two of the substance, unscrupulous merchants almost destroyed Arcona society by creating several generations of salt addicts. Salt induces vivid, colorful hallucinations in Arcona, but repeated use damages their body's ability to absorb life-giving ammonia. Only the intervention of the Republic saved the Arcona. The Senate passed draconian laws that punished the importation of salt to the Teke Ro System or to Arcona communities elsewhere in the galaxy, and the Arcona themselves zealously police their communities. Arcona addicted to salt are easily identifiable; their multifaceted eyes turn from green to gold. <\/p><p>The center of Arcona society is the family, and communities consist of several loosely affiliated extended families.

The unusual structure of their brain led Imperial xenobiologists to conclude that they were a distinctly alien Species. <\/p><p>The highly evolved Sakiyan brain is nearly twice the size of the average <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> brain.

These keen senses helped primitive Sakiyans survive against the fierce predators of their homeworld, but even as the Species developed the intellect to use tools and construct weapons and shelters, they retained their sharp senses. In fact, Sakiyans possess what other <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> consider nigh-supernatural perception. <\/p><p>A series of offworld invasions punctuate Sakiyan history, during which the culture survived by maintaining a constant state of vigilance.

Further, every household and government agency relies on lightweight repulsorlift platforms to quickly transport people, resources, and supplies to safe havens. <\/p><p>Once mobile, Sakiyan troops then conduct a constant series of hit-and-run attacks against enemies until their invaders withdraw from the conquered lands.

Sakiyans quickly adopted and improved repulsorlift technology introduced to them by Old Republic scouts. Over the centuries, they have adapted the technology to their needs, focusing primarily on making the motivators smaller and more efficient. The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hutts\">Hutts<\/a> are particularly fond of Sakiyan repulsorlift technology, as it allows them to construct smaller and more elegant repulsor sleds. <\/p><p>Thanks to its location near the heart of Hutt Space, the Sakiyan homeworld escaped the tyranny of the Empire, although many Sakiyan technicians were forced to relocate to Imperial research installations, where they contributed to the development of a new generation of Imperial repulsortanks.

The Rattataki never developed weapons of planetary scale, so the bloody world wars raged on for generations. The ceaseless violence prevented the world from developing space travel, and the Rattataki believed they were alone the galaxy- they had no concept of galactic community, and only conquering their neighbors seemed important. <\/p><p>Those that discovered <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rattatak\" title=\"Rattatak\">Rattatak<\/a> were unscrupulous slavers common in <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim\" title=\"The Outer Rim\">The Outer Rim<\/a>.

Arkanian corporations amass wealth by bringing key medical treatments and technology to the market at opportune times. Many in the galaxy find the Arkanians arrogant and aloof. They are horrified by the direction of some Arkanian research, particularly their work in genetic engineering. Indeed, the Arkanians are known to have transformed entire <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a> over the course of generations, often to the detriment of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>.&nbsp; <\/p><p>Even the Arkanian Species itself had not been off-limits to research and genetic engineering. Specific subspecies, such as the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoots\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoots\">Arkanian Offshoots<\/a>, were engineered for specific tasks. However, the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoots\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoots\">Arkanian Offshoots<\/a> are less harder and shorter lived than the original Arkanians- a trait not helped by occasional attempts by racist Purebloods to wipe them out. They also differ in physical appearance, typically in skin tone, eyes, and ears. Reactions to <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoots\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoots\">Arkanian Offshoots<\/a> vary widely within Arkanian society. Much to the horror of the occasional outsiders who visit <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoot\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoot\">Arkanian Offshoot<\/a> communities, some Arkanian regard them as merely tools or as a slave <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species\" title=\"Species\">Species<\/a>. However, such feelings are not universal. Many regard the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanian_Offshoots\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arkanian Offshoots\">Arkanian Offshoots<\/a> as an example of the cruel consequences of Arkanian corporate greed. <\/p>"

The Ebruchi put great thought into the placement of each item and layer, and all clothing is tended with exquisite care. Patches, scarves, necklaces, and intentional holes and tears are all signs of rank and achievement, although the nuances of the arrangements are lost on non-Ebruchi. <\/p>"

An escalating war with the competing empire of the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chiss\" title=\"Chiss\">Chiss<\/a> forced the Ssi-Ruuk to look toward the galactic Core for \"Recruits\" for their space fleet.

Rather than bringing the full might of the Imperial Navy to bear on the Ssi-Ruuk invaders, the Emperor negotiated to a secret treaty with them. Using prisoners and slaves as some of the raw materials for Battle Droids appealed to the Emperor; in exchange for data on the Ssi-Ruuk entechment process, Palpatine secretly ceded a number of <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Outer Rim\">Outer Rim<\/a> systems to the Ssi-Ruuk to do with as they pleased. <\/p><p>One of these star systems was <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bakura\" title=\"Bakura\">Bakura<\/a>, a small colony that had been settled by a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">Human<\/a> religious fringe group centuries before.

This represented the first time the factions in the Galactic Civil War would have to declare a temporary truce to deal with an outside threat. <\/p><p>After successfully defeating the Ssi-Ruuvi armada at Bakura, the Alliance mounted an offensive against the Ssi-Ruuk Empire. This led to on-again, off-again diplomatic talks with the Ssi-Ruuk, who lacked the resources to wage war on two fronts. Diplomatic talks with the Ssi-Ruuk continue well into <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era\" title=\"The New Jedi Order Era\">The New Jedi Order Era<\/a>, but they have not completely eliminated border skirmishes.

Squads are ideal for encounters in which the Gamemaster wants to include a large number of weaker enemies and allies, and can help replicate the chaos of a battlefield in a more manageable fashion. Similarly, Squads provide the Gamemaster with ways to transform low-CL enemies into a more significant threat. By the time the heroes hit 10th level, those CL 1 Battle Droids have ceased to be a challenge, but transforming those Droids into Squads raises their CL to the point where they can be sufficiently dangerous.\n\nA Squad represents a small number of creatures (Usually three to four) of the same type that come together into a single unit. They occupy the same space and have only one turn's worth of Actions. The Squad is an abstract concept that allows the Gamemaster to populate an encounter with low-level troopers and still maintain the speed and ease of combat they need. Squads are by no means necessary, but they do streamline the game experience. For example, a Gamemaster could create an encounter with 15 Battle Droids, or the same encounter could be created using only 5 Squads, which is more manageable."
